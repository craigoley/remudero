/**
 * Machine-filing admission (W1-T3843) runs on every filing PR's `rmd lint-plan --base`. Until
 * 2026-10-02 the only ci-friction shape it admitted was one docs file nothing reads, so every remedy
 * the gardener filed was built as a paragraph (#8302 #8476 #8507 #8514 #8544 #8546). A remedy now
 * names the code that owns its cause and the regression test its build writes — a path that cannot
 * exist yet — and admission must take it as a parked proposal, as it does the legacy shape.
