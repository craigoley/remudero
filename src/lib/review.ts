 * The JUDGE (MASTER-PLAN §12 rule 4 / rule 3B; task W1-T1C).

 * and its tests pass; it says nothing about whether the task's ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
 * were met. This module is the second half of the merge contract: after ci goes
 * green a FRESH-context REVIEW worker (never the implementer's session; read-only
 * tools + gh) verdicts each criterion against its stated PROOF and posts a commit
 * status `remudero-review`.
 *
 * THE VERDICT LOGIC IS A PURE FUNCTION ({@link judgeReview}) so the falsifier —
 * "does the reviewer actually FAIL a test-passing-but-acceptance-ignoring diff?"
 * — is a UNIT FIXTURE, proven before any live gate depends on it. The pure layer
 * is the mechanical FLOOR: it catches the failure modes that need no LLM (a proof
 * never pasted into the report; tests that assert nothing). A semantic verdict
 * from the LLM reviewer may only DOWNGRADE a criterion to failure, never rescue an
 * unpasted proof — proof must be pasted, not vibed.
 *
 * This module NEVER edits code and exposes no write path: the reviewer is
 * read-only + gh by construction (acceptance #3). It does NOT touch branch
 * protection — remudero-review is POSTED here but made REQUIRED by W1-T1D.
