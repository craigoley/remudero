/**
 * Append-only NDJSON ledger (MASTER-PLAN §9). Records the run's step timeline,
 * keyed by task id, so a run's provenance is inspectable after the fact. Every
 * line is one JSON object; `ts` is stamped here at write time.
 *
 * W1-T6: every WORKER call (recon, implement, implement.resumed) and every
 * BRAIN-PLANE call (the advisory reviewer, the retro Architect) logs the same
 * telemetry shape via {@link import("./worker.js").workerLedgerFields} —
 * `{model, effort, tokens, total_cost_usd, billing_mode, verdict}` — spread
 * onto that call's ledger line, so the full metering surface is queryable
 * uniformly regardless of which stage or tier produced the line.
