# REMUDERO — Master Plan (v2.18 · synced 2026-07-15)

**FOCUS — L2 is running: the daemon drains its own security tier.** WS-1 is COMPLETE (the daemon runs
itself) and the **§5 security tier now RUNS ON REMUDERO ITSELF** (W1-T23/#76 scanners, W1-T24/#75
ci-gate aggregator, W1-T54/#87 dep-review lane). Next, in order: **§5C task pre-flight linter
(W1-T20c/d)** → flight control (W1-T20→T21→T22) → the knowledge holes (W1-T33–T39).

**Header discipline (v2.17).** This header carries the **sync date + current focus and nothing else**.
The sections are the source of truth; read them. A retro that re-inflates this header has failed the
HARNESS-COMPRESSION bar (§Self-improvement).

**Retro ledger:** R1 (…021334) seeded CALIBRATION + P1–P5 · R2 (…391543) logged W1-T19/#34 +
W1-T3F/#35 · R3 (…446353) logged the 17 WS-1-closing merges, re-based calibration on 22 runs, mined
P6–P8 (all now closed) · **R4 (…126258, this sync)** logs the security-tier + dep-lane cycle,
**CORRECTS the FALSE-MERGED attribution of W1-T54b (#80 → #91)**, re-bases calibration on 10 runs,
mines P9–P11, and RETIRES the fully-closed P1–P8 block.

> **Remudero** — the wrangler in charge of the remuda: the hand who manages the worker herd and
> decides which mounts ride today. The orchestrator's own job title. CLI alias `rmd`.
> Domains purchased 2026-07-14. Naming saga + method: D-1.
> **Built in the open from day 1** (G-1) — instance specifics live in a gitignored `local/` overlay.
> **Fleet lives under one root** (§4A): workers are OS-sandboxed to their worktrees; the control
> panel (§7) is one daemon API with desktop + mobile as stateless projections.

## Mission

A plan-stewarding orchestration harness on top of Claude Code. A durable main agent runs the
plan → recon → prompt → implement → review → merge → plan-sync loop against headless Claude Code
workers in git worktrees, escalating to the human like a senior engineer would: rarely, batched,
with options and a recommendation. Open source; runs on a Claude Code subscription; GitHub-native.

**Differentiators vs. the field** (session managers like Claude Squad/Crystal/Vibe Kanban;
autonomous-PR tools like Composio AO; plan-lifecycle tools like ivy-tendril; native Agent Teams):

1. **Plan stewardship** — MASTER-PLAN.md + tasks.yaml in git is the product; the harness keeps it true.
2. **Provenance gate** — no claim enters a worker prompt without a cited source. Mechanized, not disciplined.
3. **Principles engine** — TDD/DRY/SOLID enforced as deterministic gates + reviewer rubric, not prompt vibes.
4. **Deterministic control plane** — scheduling, trust, budgets, and strikes are code; LLMs never own the loop.
5. **Escalation as GitHub issues** — decisions get provenance, threading, and an audit trail for free.
6. **Durable by design** — native Agent Teams is interactive/ephemeral with documented coordination gaps
   (leads stopping early, task-status lag); Remudero is a daemon that survives restarts and works for days.

## NET STATE

★ **WS-1 COMPLETE (2026-07-15): the daemon runs itself.** The self-hosting exit criterion is MET —
`rmd daemon`, launchctl-loaded against **remudero-sandbox**, drained **SBX-T1/T2/T3 unattended → merged
PRs #6/#7/#8**, booting ANTHROPIC-clean (`env_clean=true`, `billing_mode=subscription`), then survived a
**kill-9 + launchd KeepAlive restart** recovering to correct GitHub-derived state with **no duplicate task
run** (W1-T12d, verify:human, operator-attested — evidence in the task's `satisfied_by`). The spine and its
PR links are in the SHIPPED log. **Three honest deltas, stated once and owed to WS-7's chaos drills:** the
drill was bounded (`--max 3`, not overnight); no digest send was captured; the kill landed post-drain, so
recovery is proven by no-duplicate + clean idle, not an active `reconstructOrphan`. The self-hosting
CAPABILITY is proven regardless. (§5C's task-pre-flight PLAN is #58; the linter CODE — W1-T20c — is still
QUEUED, and this plan does not claim the mechanism exists.)

★ **L2 IS LIVE (2026-07-15): the harness drained its own SECURITY TIER.** §5's Tier-1 stack now runs on
remudero itself — CodeQL/OSV/Dependabot/leak-grep (W1-T23/#76), the **ci-gate aggregator** as the single
required context (W1-T24/#75, live-proven by the W1-T24b probes #82/#85), and the **dep-review lane**
(W1-T54/#87) with its live proof against the real parked Dependabot PRs (W1-T54b/#91). §5A's "the harness
eats first" is now FACT on the security tier, not intention.

★ **THE FIRST INTEGRITY INVERSION — found, fixed, and it poisoned this retro's own gather.** Run
`W1-T54b-1784151420811` was ledgered **`verdict=merged` against PR #80 — DEPENDABOT'S PR**, which it did
not author (real output: **#91**). Every prior failure class was an honest UNDER-claim (`no_pr`,
`blocked_*`, `error_max_turns`); this one **CLAIMED work it did not do** — a worse class, and the reason
attribution is now a gate concern, not bookkeeping. **W1-T62/#93 fixed the parser; the corrupt data it
already emitted SURVIVES** (#80's body still carries the task trailer, which is how this retro's gather
reported `W1-T54b → #80`). Mechanism, residue, and the un-stamp proposal: **P9**.

**Inventory (verified 2026-07-15 via `gh pr list --state merged`: 82 merged PRs on `remudero`, 6 on
`remudero-sandbox`).** WS-0 spike SHIPPED (7/7 verdicts GREEN, PR #1). WS-1 then ate its ENTIRE backlog
through its own proto-runner:

- **the gate** — reviewer + enforced merge gate (W1-T1C/#11, W1-T1D/#12); reviewer verifies against
  REPO STATE, not diff+report (W1-T3F/#35);
- **the arc** — escalation issues + notifier + daily digest, decomposed 5/5 by rule 16 (W1-T3 + B/C/D/E
  → #26–#30);
- **knowledge** — Promptsmith LEARNINGS injection, the READ side of the compounding thesis (W1-T19/#34);
- **resource primitives** — HeadroomTracker v0 (W1-T4/#39), NDJSON ledger + context telemetry (W1-T6/#47),
  transient-vs-strike classifier + diagnose-then-retry (W1-T7/#48), config loader + tier detection +
  `rmd init` wizard (W1-T9a/b/c → #53–#55);
- **the daemon spine** — fleet control set (W1-T11/#56), scheduler loop (W1-T12a/#61), launchd unit +
  ANTHROPIC-clean boot assertion (W1-T12b/#62), crash recovery (W1-T12c/#63), live commissioning
  (W1-T12d, verify:human) + CLI/daemon hardening (#67/#68);
- **the operator surface** — `rmd` as a real installable CLI (W1-T14/#65), plan-sync as an in-repo PR
  flow (W1-T15/#66).

**★ CORRECTION (R4): mounts.yaml v0 (W1-T5) IS SHIPPED — #42, with Tier-Invariant validation, on disk at
`.remudero/mounts.yaml` and re-based to a flat-400 tripwire by #90.** Through v2.17 this line claimed it
was still planned while the SHIPPED log two screens down recorded its merge — the document contradicted
itself for a full retro. The calibration table below does not exist to UNBLOCK W1-T5; it exists to
**re-base the mount table W1-T5 already shipped**.

**Still PLANNED, not shipped** (the honest remainder): §8A/§8B knowledge architecture + the five
knowledge-hole tasks W1-T33–T39 (PR #36); flight control W1-T20–T22 + §5C's task linter W1-T20c/d.

**NEXT (L2) — kick order, re-graded against R4's data:** **plan-health (W1-T20c/d, W1-T20) →
quality/architecture (W1-T25/T26/T28) → W1-T27 → W2-T2 fleet dry-run.** The security tier that led this
order is **DONE** (W1-T24/#75 → W1-T23/#76, both merged gate-side this cycle), so the pre-flight linter
W1-T20c/d now leads on its own merit: it gates every task dispatched after it, and R4's failure mining
(P10/P11) is almost entirely task-quality and cap-plumbing — exactly its remit. NOTE: `nextRunnable`
(drain.ts:31 `plan.tasks.find`) is DECLARATION-ORDERED, but the daemon currently drains the SANDBOX; the
remudero queue is operator-kicked, so this is the authoritative KICK ORDER (mirrored as a comment atop
plan/tasks.yaml). Remaining fleet ops (§5D, W1-T55–T57) fold in alongside.

## Calibration (observed — through RETRO-1784155126258, 2026-07-15)

The empirical baseline **mounts.yaml (W1-T5, shipped #42)** and Flight-control burn-rate signals (§4B
Layer 1) key off. Only `implement` has data; recon/reviewer/diagnose accrue no rows until they run as
typed tasks — **and R4 shows that gap is no longer cosmetic (P10).**

**★ CURRENT BASELINE — this cycle (RETRO-1784155126258, 10 runs). This is the row W1-T5's table keys off:**

| task_type | runs | merged | avg $ | avg turns | total $ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| implement | 10 | 2 | $3.290 | 54.5 | $32.897 |

**★ READ THE `merged: 2` CORRECTLY — it is a GATHER ARTIFACT, not a collapse.** The 2 is LEDGER-derived
(`verdict==="merged"`). **GitHub-derived task-bearing merges this cycle = 6**: W1-T23/#76, W1-T24/#75,
W1-T24b/#85 and W1-T54/#87 all merged GATE-SIDE after their runs ended `blocked_review`. True merge rate
is **6/10 (60%)**, not 20%. Worse, **one of the 2 ledger merges is FALSE** (W1-T54b→#80, Dependabot's PR —
NET STATE), so the ledger is 1-real + 1-false while GitHub is 6-real. This is the SAME 15→17 gap R3 hit,
and **W1-T51 — filed then precisely to close it — is still UNBUILT, so it recurred verbatim** (P11).

**Prior cycles (FOLDED — trend only):** R3 22 runs / 15 merged / $3.218 avg / 45.2 turns · R1+R2 19 runs /
11 merged / $1.838 avg / 21.4 turns. **Derived all-time:** 51 runs, ~32 merged, ~$138.6 total.

**Reads:**
- **Cost per run is FLAT ($3.22 → $3.29) while turns rose 45.2 → 54.5.** Two retros ago the mean doubled;
  it has now plateaued. The turn rise without a cost rise is consistent with cheaper per-turn work
  (probes, `gh` calls, live-gate observation) rather than more expensive reasoning — this cycle's tasks
  were gate-and-lane work whose proof is live GitHub state, not big diffs.
- **`blocked_review`×4 is this cycle's largest class — and ALL FOUR were HONEST BLOCKS THAT THEN MERGED.**
  Every one failed on a criterion demanding LIVE proof the worker could not produce in-flight (planted-CVE
  flagged, branch protection reads one aggregator, a skipped sub-job does not deadlock, a seeded bump
  merges). The gate did its job; a human/Architect closed the gap; the PR merged. This is not a failure
  class to fix — it is the **bootstrap class** (§5D, T24/T24b/T54 splits) behaving as designed. **Do not
  mine it as breakage** (the R3 lesson on `blocked_review`, re-confirmed).
- **The $100 `budget_usd` tripwire sits ~30× the mean; 0/10 budget trips.** Still a runaway detector, not
  an allowance (§9). No action. (Rule 19's citation was corrected to the 45.2 baseline by R3's P7 and is
  restated there, not here — one fact, one home.)

## Retro proposals (PROPOSALS ONLY; NOT yet in plan/tasks.yaml)

**RETRO-1784155126258 (this cycle)** — mined from the 8 non-merges of 10 runs (`blocked_review`×4,
`no_pr`×2, `failed`×1, `incomplete`×1). Candidate golden/plan tasks for the Architect to ratify via a
tasks.yaml PR — never auto-filed, never worker-edited (rule 15).

- **★ P9 (plan + golden) — THE FALSE ATTRIBUTION SURVIVES ITS OWN FIX. Highest value in this list.**
  W1-T62/#93 fixed the *parser* (anchored `PR_URL` + ownership guard), so no FUTURE run can mis-attribute.
  It did **not** undo what the bad run already wrote: **PR #80's body still carries
  `Remudero-Task: W1-T54b`** (run-task stamps the trailer onto the PR it believes it owns). Consequences,
  both live: (a) **this retro's gather read that trailer and reported `W1-T54b → #80`** — a plan-layer
  artifact was produced from the false claim, and only W1-T62's `note:` stopped it entering the SHIPPED
  log; (b) **W1-T51 (union the gather over ledger + GitHub) would INHERIT the false trailer from the
  GitHub side** — hardening the ledger while the GitHub side trusts an unverified trailer just moves the
  hole. Propose: **(i)** un-stamp #80 (one-time data correction, plan-only/human-authored — a worker must
  never edit attribution evidence); **(ii)** the gather asserts **trailer ⇒ ownership** (PR head branch
  belongs to the claiming run) before crediting a merge — the same guard W1-T62 put in the runner, applied
  at the READ side; **(iii)** a golden: *a run whose output cites foreign pull-URLs attributes to its own
  PR or to nothing*. **(iv)** the gather HONORS the ledger's own corrections — a `correction.provenance`
  line for a run OVERRIDES that run's `verdict.pr_url` in mergedSince (the operator already wrote the
  truth, #91; the reducer must not re-derive it, and must not wait on W1-T51's GitHub union, which P11
  flags is unbuilt). GENERALIZE: `correction.provenance` is a FIRST-CLASS ledger EVENT, not a note — every
  consumer (mergedSince/gatherRuns, deriveStatus, calibration, `rmd trace`) reads corrections, or the
  append-only ledger's integrity is only as good as its least-aware reader. This is the READ-side dual of
  W1-T62's write-side guard: an inversion the runner can no longer WRITE can still be READ by a consumer
  that ignores the correction. **The general lesson, which is bigger than this bug: a fix that repairs the mechanism
  but not the CORRUPT DATA IT ALREADY EMITTED is half a fix — and the plan is downstream of that data.**
- **★ P10 (plan) — RATIFIED 2026-07-16 -> W1-T63 (reviewer mount-governance + reviewer_outcome; P10-a fail-open observability folded in). §9's "never a hardcoded literal" is enforced on the IMPLEMENT path ONLY; the phases
  that actually walled this cycle are the ones mounts.yaml cannot reach.** #90 re-based every mount to a
  flat 400-turn tripwire, and §9 now reads as though the runaway cliff is uniformly 400. **It is not.**
  Three of ten runs ended `error_max_turns` — and in `W1-T54b-1784151420811` the walling phase came AFTER
  a 19-turn implement phase that had already opened its PR (evidence: the ledger's `error_max_turns` line
  carries `total_cost_usd` but no `num_turns`, at 21:44 — *after* #90 merged at 21:35). Grep confirms the
  plumbing gap: `run-task.ts:946/:1018` correctly read `mount.maxTurns`, while **`run-task.ts:385`
  (`maxTurns: 12`), `run-task.ts:1488` (`maxTurns: 40`), and `containment.ts:122` (`maxTurns: 6`) are
  hardcoded literals** — four lines below a comment at `run-task.ts:750` that says *"never a hardcoded
  literal."* Compounding it, **`.remudero/mounts.yaml` has rows for `recon` and `implement` ONLY** — there
  is no `reviewer`/`fix`/`diagnose` row for those phases to key off even if they asked. Propose a plan PR
  that (a) names which phases are mount-governed vs deliberately-bounded (recon's `maxTurns: 8` is a
  DEFENSIBLE literal — §9 should say so), (b) adds the missing task_type rows, (c) corrects §9's flat-400
  claim to the truth. **Do not raise a cap to fix this** (rule 19); the finding is that a doctrine was
  believed to be enforced where it was never plumbed.

  ★ ADDENDUM (the fail-open MODE, distinct from the walling FREQUENCY above). A turn-budget fix makes the reviewer wall LESS; it does nothing when it walls ANYWAY. Ledger evidence, TWICE this cycle — runs W1-T54b-1784151420811 AND W1-T62-1784153160547 both show `review.reviewer verdict=error_max_turns, downgrades=0` -> `review.posted state=success` (floor-only) -> `automerge.armed` -> merged. In the ledger AND the console ('remudero-review: PASS - N criteria substantiated') a floor-only pass is BYTE-IDENTICAL to a completed review, so a risk:high PR can merge with ZERO completed LLM review, invisibly. The dead reviewer did NOT cause the #80 inversion (the parser did; the reviewer checks criteria-vs-repo, not attribution) - two independent holes that co-occurred. Propose: (a) SURFACE `reviewer_outcome`/subtype on the `review.posted` ledger line + the console, so a floor-only merge is legible not silent (the handoff's standing candidate); (b) DESIGN QUESTION for the operator - should a risk:high PR HOLD (not arm) when the reviewer does not COMPLETE, or is fail-to-floor intended (floor-is-the-guarantee, Sec 5)? (a) is design-neutral observability and clearly missing; (b) trades against the doctrine and is the operator's call, not asserted here.
- **P11 (plan → build) — W1-T51 was filed a retro ago to close the gate-side-merge gap, and the gap
  recurred VERBATIM this cycle (4 of 6 real merges invisible to the gather).** R3 hit 15-vs-17 and filed
  W1-T51; R4 hit 2-vs-6 and hand-reconciled it AGAIN. **This is P8's "an unratified proposal decays"
  finding, one level up: W1-T51 was ratified into a task and still decayed, because RATIFICATION IS NOT
  EXECUTION.** A filed-but-unbuilt task predicted the exact failure that then recurred — and the retro
  paid the cost by hand both times. Propose: rank W1-T51 ahead of new plan-health work (it is cheap, and
  every future retro's numbers are wrong until it lands), and extend the ratify-or-kill duty to flag **a
  RATIFIED task that has survived two retros unbuilt** as a plan-health signal (a W1-T20d input) — not
  just an unratified proposal.
- *(learning-system completeness review — Architect + research 2026-07-15)* ★ P12 (plan + measurement) — WE INJECT LEARNINGS BUT NEVER MEASURE WHETHER THEY HELP: the learning system has no effectiveness signal, so it cannot be shown to compound. W1-T19 injects matched learnings; W1-T34 (proposed) prunes STALE ones; W1-T38 (proposed) caps SIZE. NONE tracks UTILITY — whether an injected learning is load-bearing. The 2026 memory literature names the metric: the WIPE TEST [research: self-evolving-agents-2026] — what performance survives if external memory is deleted; a memory-centric system (Remudero, deliberately — no weight updates) must PROVE its gains, or 'better notes' is unfalsifiable. Measured directly as RELIABILITY (success rate over repeats) + EFFICIENCY (turns/cost) [research: procedural-memory-reliability]. For Remudero: (i) ledger, per injected learning, whether the run it fed MERGED clean vs needed fix/diagnose — a learning accrues a utility signal; (ii) periodically run a task-CLASS with learnings SUPPRESSED (a Wipe-Test golden on the sandbox) and compare merge-rate/turns to the injected baseline; (iii) feed utility INTO W1-T34 quarantine + W1-T38 budget — prune LOW-utility as hard as STALE, so the corpus is pruned by VALUE, not only truth and size. This is the metric the whole Self-improvement section exists to make true and currently asserts without evidence.
- *(learning-system completeness review — Architect + research 2026-07-15)* ★ P13 (plan) — THE FLYWHEEL MINES FAILURE, NOT SUCCESS: half the compounding loop is missing. Self-improvement's flywheel reads the ledger for FAILURE patterns (repeated transients, prompts that needed fixes, gates that never fire, reviewer misses). The 2026 frontier distills BOTH: successful trajectories -> reusable procedures, failed -> corrective lessons [research: reasoningbank, expel, agentic-workflow-memory, trajectory-informed-memory]. Remudero captures a clean single-shot merge NOWHERE — the prompt shape that produced W1-T3F at 21 turns, or a 4-turn recon, is never distilled into procedural memory (the Sec 5B skill registry / a template diff). Propose: extend the flywheel + retro to mine SUCCESSFUL runs — a run that merged clean, fast, first-try is a POSITIVE signal whose reusable shape becomes a procedural-memory proposal (skill-registry entry or template diff), gated behind the golden suite like any knowledge change (RSI-safety unchanged). 'Compounding engineering' completed: codify what WORKS, not only patch what breaks.
- *(learning-system completeness review — Architect + research 2026-07-15)* P14 (plan -> extends W1-T33) — CONSOLIDATION HAS NO CONTRADICTION DETECTION; supersession is recency-overwrite. W1-T33 (proposed) adds a lifecycle (active|superseded) and filters superseded entries, but marking-superseded is MANUAL and nothing DETECTS when a newly-distilled learning CONTRADICTS an existing one. The 2026 consolidation literature makes conflict detection explicit — multi-pass consolidation with conflict resolution [research: trace2skill, scientific-agent-consolidation] — and names naive recency-overwrite's failure: it breaks when knowledge is REFINED, not replaced. Propose (fold into W1-T33's ratification): the DISTILL/retro consolidation pass, before adding a learning, checks it against existing entries on the same subsystem/files for CONTRADICTION and forces an explicit supersede-or-reconcile decision — a contradiction may never SILENTLY coexist with the entry it contradicts (both would inject; a worker would receive mutually-exclusive guidance).
- **`no_pr`×2 + `failed`×1 + `incomplete`×1 — NO new proposal; folded into the OPEN W1-T52 triage.**
  W1-T52 (filed by R3 for `failed`/`incomplete`) already owns the transcript pass; both `no_pr` runs were
  W1-T24b, whose criteria demanded live post-flip proof — the bootstrap class, and the ordering fix
  already shipped via the #84/#77 splits. Adding a fourth proposal here would be accretion, not analysis.

**Closed proposals (P1–P8) — RETIRED FROM THIS LIST, ids preserved.** Per RATIFY-OR-KILL every one now has
a terminal status, so the ~50 lines of adjudication prose they carried are DELETED rather than maintained
twice (the tasks are the record now): **P1**→W1-T59 (filed, deprioritized) · **P2**→retired as superseded
by §9 (it proposed the tripwire-as-work-limit bug) · **P3**→W1-T58 · **P4**→folded into W1-T24 (SHIPPED
#75) · **P5, P6**→W1-T52 (open) · **P7**→ratified into rule 19's citation · **P8**→W1-T58 + the
ratify-or-kill duty (§Self-improvement). A closed proposal's reasoning lives in its task or in the rule it
amended; restating it here is what turns this list into the graveyard P8 warned about.

## FIELD FINDINGS (from the mini, 2026-07-14 — ground truth, not docs)

1. **★ RESOLVED — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exported from `~/.zshrc` (lines 20 AND 21 — duplicate, same
   key both times, benign)**;
   Claude Code confirms it **takes precedence over the claude.ai login**. NOT set via
   `launchctl setenv` (checked: 0) ⇒ launchd-spawned processes do NOT inherit it. **PROOF (verdict 1
   GREEN)**: with ANTHROPIC_* stripped from the env, `claude -p` returns `ok` and the precedence
   warning DISAPPEARS ⇒ headless runs on subscription OAuth. ⇒ **Env sanitization is a control-plane
   primitive** (§9); `billing_mode` is a decision the harness makes, never an accident it inherits.
2. **★ SIDE FINDING (Craig's money, outside Remudero's scope)**: because the key is exported from
   the login shell, **every interactive `claude` session on the mini has been billing API rates
   instead of the Max 20x subscription.** Fix (separate task, do NOT delete the key — ClawApp/
   OpenClaw Python + Haiku need it): scope it to the LaunchAgent plists' EnvironmentVariables and
   crontab entries rather than exporting it from `.zshrc`.
3. **`claude` is a shell FUNCTION** (wraps the binary with `security unlock-keychain` when
   `$SSH_CONNECTION` is set). Real binary: `~/.npm-global/bin/claude` → `claude.exe` (same
   `.npm-global/bin` as the openclaw CLI). ⇒ daemon resolves the binary from **config, never PATH**;
   committed code carries no machine paths (path lives in `~/.config/remudero/config.json`, outside
   the tree).
4. **★ RESOLVED — launchd + keychain OAuth: PASS.** A launchd-spawned `claude` returned `ok` with
   EMPTY stderr ⇒ the keychain is reachable from the user-agent context; **WS-1's LaunchAgent
   architecture stands**. Nuance (do NOT delete env.ts on this basis): launchd never sources
   `.zshrc`, so that process had no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and was clean *by accident of context* — a
   daemon started from a DEV SHELL inherits the key and would silently bill API. `buildWorkerEnv()`
   is what makes the dev path as safe as the launchd path. Residual: proven in a live session;
   **reboot-resilience (auto-login → session → unlocked keychain) is unverified ⇒ WS-7 chaos drill**,
   not an assumption.
5. Versions observed: Claude Code **2.1.209**, node **v22.22.3** (/opt/homebrew/bin/node), gh
   **2.92.0** authed as **cao825**. Pin CLI version as config (WS-7); node via engines/.nvmrc.
6. Paste-block discipline (self-inflicted, logged): **no inline `#` comments, no heredocs** in
   paste blocks for this operator's zsh — a violated standing rule cost a full setup block.
7. Workspace + deny-floor overlay live: `~/Remudero/{worktrees,state,logs,tmp}`;
   `~/.config/remudero/deny.local` = openclaw, LaunchAgents, health-status,
   `~/Library/Messages/chat.db` (path verified by `find`, not guessed).
8. **★ GitHub topology + fresh-repo defaults (generalizable — Setup Agent requirement)**:
   `craigoley` is an **Organization**, not a user; the agent account (cao825) is a member with
   `permissions.admin: true` on org repos it creates ⇒ no collaborator grant, no invitation flow.
   The Setup Agent (WS-4) must handle **org-vs-user namespaces** and verify access by reading
   `repos/{owner}/{repo}.permissions`, never by assuming an invite is needed. **Fresh repos ship
   with `allow_auto_merge: false` and secret scanning DISABLED** — an agent pipeline that arms
   `gh pr merge --auto` will silently fail to arm on a default repo. Scaffold MUST explicitly set:
   `allow_auto_merge: true`, `delete_branch_on_merge: true`, and (public repos)
   **secret_scanning + secret_scanning_push_protection: enabled** — push protection is a hard
   backstop under the leak-grep for repos where autonomous agents commit. Also note: cloning is
   **HTTPS-only** on this account (no SSH key); never rewrite a remote to `git@github.com`.
9. **★ Scoped PAT DEFERRED (WS-0 runs on ambient gh credentials).** Fine-grained PATs on an
   ORG-owned repo require the org to opt in first (Settings → Third-party Access → PATs) — until
   then `craigoley` isn't even selectable as resource owner. Decision: do NOT flip an org-wide
   setting (that namespace also holds the production fleet) as a 6am unblock. **Security delta,
   stated plainly**: WS-0 workers carry cao825's repo-scope reach instead of sandbox-only reach.
   Containment still rests on OS sandbox + deny-hook + worktree scoping — always the real boundary;
   the PAT was a blast-radius optimization. **Compensating control enabled instead: secret scanning
   + push protection ON for both public repos** — GitHub now rejects a committed credential
   outright, covering a failure mode PAT-scoping never addressed. Scoped-PAT injection via
   `buildWorkerEnv()` = **WS-1 hardening task**.
10. **★ SPIKE GROUND TRUTH (WS-0, all seven verdicts GREEN).** **Full record: `FINDINGS.md` in-repo**;
    this list is the LIVE RESIDUE + reference data only. _R4 deleted b/c/d/e/h: `total_cost_usd`-is-
    notional and `/usage`-is-the-window-source are stated in full in §9; `USER`-for-OAuth and
    `~/.claude.json` tier keys SHIPPED (W1-T9b + env allowlist); SDK-0.3.209's settings/sandbox conflict
    is version-stale (we ship 0.3.210 as of #80)._
    a. **Worker settings FAIL SILENTLY.** `-p` ignores a settings file that fails schema validation —
       a typo does not error, it **drops containment**. The installed schema nests `allowedDomains`
       under `network` (the original prompt put it at the sandbox root ⇒ would have been dropped).
       ⇒ validate-before-spawn guard + a probe as the empirical backstop. **Still the canonical citation
       for §5's containment-probe requirement and rule 11 — keep.**
    f. **Linked-worktree `.git` is OUTSIDE the sandbox write scope** ⇒ `git push -u` is OS-denied on
       the config write (push itself succeeds). **Push without `-u`** — still binding on every runner and
       every retro.
    g. Real knob names (the mounts.yaml vocabulary — W1-T5 shipped on these): `--max-budget-usd`/
       `maxBudgetUsd` (breach ⇒ `error_max_budget_usd`) · `--effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max` ·
       `thinking:{adaptive|enabled+budgetTokens|disabled}` · `maxTurns` · `autoCompactThreshold` ·
       `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` · `env` (**replaces** the child env entirely — the billing boundary's
       enforcement point).
    i. claude-code#20946 (hook-block-in-bypass async race) **did NOT reproduce on 2.1.209** — the
       deterministic floor held. The `dontAsk` fallback is implemented but **UNTESTED** (golden task).
    j. Near-miss disclosed by the worker: the DECISION_REQUEST parser captured `")"` from an inline
       `(RECOMMENDED)` marker and was right only by luck ⇒ **auto-choose parser golden task**. ★ R4 note:
       this is the SAME defect class as W1-T62's false attribution — a parser taking the first plausible
       match instead of the anchored one. **Two instances now; P9's golden should cover the class.**
11. **★ UNATTENDED-RUNS HARDENING (PR #8, W1-T1C dead-run post-mortem — see LEARNINGS.md).** Full list
    lives in `LEARNINGS.md` at repo root (WS-8 knowledge pipeline); the load-bearing ones:
    a. **Claude Code's Bash-tool snapshot sources `$HOME/.zshrc` via `os.homedir()` — `ZDOTDIR` is
       IGNORED.** Shell isolation must set `CLAUDE_CODE_SHELL` (the rc filename follows the shell),
       never ZDOTDIR alone. Disassembled the installed binary to establish this (Standing rule 7). [PR #8]
    b. **The current `/bin/bash` isolation works ONLY because `~/.bashrc` is absent on this host** — an
       accident, not construction; a populated `~/.bashrc` isolates nothing ⇒ **W1-T17 preflight probe
       (fail-closed) + W1-T18 general mechanism (OSS blocker).** [PR #8]
    c. **The SDK yields the `type:"result"` envelope (`num_turns`, `total_cost_usd`, `subtype`) and THEN
       throws** from the iterator on an error subtype — read the envelope before the catch, or a failed
       run looks free in the ledger (failures are the runs that burn most). [PR #8]
    d. **`maxBudgetUsd` is checked BETWEEN turns**: a $0.01 budget produced $0.21 of real spend. It is a
       circuit breaker with up to one turn of overshoot, NOT a hard cap — budgets need headroom. [PR #8]
    e. Reaffirms 10a (settings fail SILENTLY under `-p`) and the `$loose`-schema catch (W1-T1): validating
       against the SDK schema alone PASSES a misplaced key — validate shape explicitly. [WS-0 / W1-T1]
12. **★ SELF-UPDATER RACE (run W1-T1C-1784038021919).** Claude Code's **background self-updater**
    `npm install`s the CLI into the global prefix mid-session; a worker spawn landing in npm's
    unlink/relink window dies **ENOENT**, which the SDK misreports as *"native binary not found"*. Every
    live `claude` runs its own updater ⇒ fleet concurrency is a **thundering herd** that widens the
    window. Mitigation: workers set `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` (confirm empirically — rule 7; reports say it
    is sometimes not honored), the runner **retries ENOENT-class spawn failures** (safe: no turns/cost
    before the first message), and long-term the CLI version is pinned config (WS-7). **This is the first
    "guard caught it AFTER the burn, not while it went wrong" case that motivates §4B Flight control.**
    **Full narrative, the two diagnostic corollaries (the message is diagnostic; evidence by BIRTHTIME
    `stat -f %SB`, never existence) and the exact falsifier live in `DIAGNOSIS.md` + `LEARNINGS.md` — the
    full restatement that sat here is DELETED (this plan's own §8A: retrieve, do not inject).**

## Bootstrap ladder — Remudero builds Remudero

The dogfooding requirement, made structural. Each rung uses the previous rung to build the next:

- **L0 — DONE**: the human loop — Craig + external Claude produce prompts; Claude Code executes them.
  Built: the WS-0 spike.
- **L1 — DONE (2026-07-15)**: **proto-runner** — `run-task.ts`, one tasks.yaml entry in, recon →
  provenance-linted prompt → implement → PR → verdict out, kicked manually. It executed WS-1's entire
  own task list, one kick per task. Dogfooding started before the daemon existed, as designed.
- **L2 (★ ACTIVE — WS-1 complete)**: the daemon loops unattended; WS-2+ backlogs execute through it.
  The plan repo's tasks.yaml is the first plan Remudero stewards. Proven by the SBX-T1/T2/T3 drain.
- **L3**: the flywheel (below) files improvement tasks on Remudero from Remudero's own ledger —
  the harness maintains itself, human approves plan-increment PRs.

Rule: no rung is built by hand if the rung below can build it.

## 1. Architecture — four planes

**Control plane** — deterministic TypeScript daemon (launchd/systemd-supervised). Owns: task DAG
scheduler, worktree lifecycle + GC, worker process supervision, PR watching + stuck-PR shepherd,
attempt/strike accounting, budget metering, escalation queue, notifier dispatch, **worker
environment construction** (explicit allowlist; ANTHROPIC_* stripped — §9) and **claude-binary
path resolution from config** (never PATH-dependent — FIELD FINDING 2), and the fleet control set: **Pause** (drain-and-hold: no new worker spawns; in-flight tasks run to FULL
completion — through verdict and merge — so state stays clean; watchers and shepherd keep
running), **Resume**, and **Stop** (hard kill: `STOP` file checked every tick + UI button).
`rmd pause|resume|stop` mirrors the panel. Zero LLM decisions. Crash recovery: all durable state
derives from git + GitHub; local queue/locks are rebuildable cache.

**Brain plane** — model calls at phase boundaries only. Two roles, one service, model-routed:
- **Architect** (Opus-class, extended thinking + web search): grill-me intake, plan authorship/revision,
  narrative plan syncs at workstream boundaries, escalation drafting, next-increment drafting when idle.
- **Promptsmith/Reviewer** (Sonnet-class, per-loop): renders task+recon into worker prompts
  (house format, provenance-linted), verdicts worker REPORTs and PR diffs against acceptance proofs,
  resolves DECISION_REQUESTs (auto-choose).

**Worker plane** — Agent SDK sessions (`query({ cwd: worktree, ... })`), typed by phase:
- **recon**: read-only tools; output contract = OBSERVED / INFERRED / COULDN'T-VERIFY sections; TTL'd.
- **implement**: full tools per permission profile; branch from latest origin/main; one concern; opens PR;
  ends with structured REPORT (changed / proven / inferred / open questions / PR_URL).
- **fix**: resume original session (round 1) → fresh session with distilled context (round 2).
- **diagnose**: evidence-only worker dispatched after two strikes; per-step telemetry; no patches.
- **reviewer**: fresh context, read-only + gh; adversarial audit vs. acceptance proofs + principles rubric.
Workers get **no MCP config** (MCP auto-approves under bypass — surface stays zero).

**Interface plane** — the **control panel**: one daemon API (REST + SSE, tailnet, bearer-scoped),
with every client a **stateless projection** of it — the web dashboard (desktop: served on the Mac,
opened in any browser; Tauri menu-bar wrapper banked), the Expo mobile app (G-5), and **remudero-mcp**
(so any Claude — claude.ai via custom connector, Claude Code sessions, the Architect — reads and
proposes against the same plan). Desktop↔mobile "sync" is free by construction: no state lives in
clients; state lives in git + the ledger; clients subscribe via SSE and reconcile optimistic updates.
Notifier adapters, reference-first per Q2/G-15 (nothing Craig-specific in the default path):
**imessage-local** — the daemon lives ON a Mac, so it sends iMessage-to-self natively via
osascript/Messages.app, zero extra infrastructure for the Mac+iPhone operator (one-time Automation
TCC grant; verify-under-launchd is a WS-1 check) → **github-issues** (universal, mobile-push free)
→ ntfy / Slack / Discord / email / webhook. BlueBubbles becomes a Craig-legacy optional overlay,
not a dependency. M2's Expo app brings true APNs push later.

## 2. Plan format & contracts

**Per product**: the design repo holds `MASTER-PLAN.md` (human narrative, this document's format)
and machine state:

```yaml
# plan/tasks.yaml (schema v1)
- id: F1-3
  title: Escalation issues + iMessage digest
  repo: remudero                # target repo
  depends_on: [F1-1, F1-2]    # may cross repos → ordered bundles
  type: implement             # recon|implement|diagnose|review|manual
  verify: auto                # auto|human  (human ⇒ draft PR + MANUAL escalation, never auto-merge)
  principles: {tdd: strict, dup_budget: default, fitness: default}   # overrides per task
  acceptance:
    - claim: "escalation lands as a labeled GitHub issue"
      proof: "issue URL + label visible via gh issue view"
    - claim: "daily digest sends"
      proof: "notifier ledger line + received message screenshot ref"
  status: queued              # queued|recon|prompted|running|review|fixing|diagnosing|blocked|merged|done
  attempts: 0                 # strikes: deterministic failures only
  session_id: null
  pr: null
  budget_usd: 3.00
```

**Plan-repo write discipline — status is DERIVED, not written (CORRECTED by W1-T1).** `tasks.yaml`
is a pure DECLARATION: human/Architect-authored, comment-rich, edited only via PR. The machine NEVER
rewrites it (YAML round-trip destroys comments; status commits spam a public repo's history; and a
machine writer racing a human editor is a conflict class we can simply not have). **Task status is
DERIVED from GitHub** — merged iff a PR naming the task id is merged; blocked iff an escalation issue
is open; running iff a worker lock exists — with a cached projection in `state/`. GitHub is
authoritative, so crash recovery needs no local state at all. The control plane still appends to
questions.ndjson / DECISIONS.md / the ledger (append-only, no round-trip hazard), debounced to
≤1 commit/min. Humans and the Architect edit narrative (MASTER-PLAN prose, LEARNINGS,
templates) via PRs. Field ownership is documented per file; a conflict between a machine commit and
a human edit resolves human-wins-on-narrative, machine-wins-on-status.

**Worker output contracts** (parsed from result JSON; malformed ⇒ one reformat retry ⇒ strike):
- `RECON REPORT` — OBSERVED (command + output), INFERRED, COULDN'T-VERIFY. Prompts may cite only OBSERVED.
- `REPORT` — changed / proven (proof pasted) / inferred / open questions / PR_URL.
- `DECISION_REQUEST` — options[], exactly one RECOMMENDED, reversibility note. Resolved machine-side.
- `QUESTION` — **non-blocking**: {question, current_assumption (the worker proceeds on this),
  impact_if_wrong: low|med, task}. Logged to the ledger + `plan/questions.ndjson`; surfaced as a
  batch-answerable backlog in the control panel and counted in the daily digest. Answers feed the
  Architect → plan/LEARNINGS updates; an answer contradicting a shipped assumption auto-files a
  corrective task. **Rule**: high-impact + hard-to-reverse is never a QUESTION — that's an
  escalation. Everything else: assume, log, keep moving.

**Provenance gate**: every CONTEXT claim in a rendered prompt carries `[src: recon#… | plan#… |
PR#/commit | URL]`. Deterministic linter blocks dispatch of uncited prompts. Recon TTL: prompts
never render from stale recon. Rule: **PROVENANCE OR IT DOESN'T GO IN A PROMPT.**

## 3. The loop (per task)

queued → **recon** → **prompt** (provenance-linted) → **running** (implement worker) → PR open →
**review** (reviewer verdict + CI) → merge (existing trusted-author auto-merge, base==main) →
**plan-sync** (status flip by control plane; narrative sync by Architect at workstream boundaries)
→ next task. Failure paths: red CI/changes-requested → **fixing** (resume, round 1; fresh, round 2)
→ two strikes → **diagnosing** (evidence worker) → one evidence-armed retry → **blocked** (escalate).

## 3A. Campaigns (cross-repo improvement cycles)

Injectable, reusable improvement sweeps — "recon and implement across all repos for X" as a
first-class object, not a hand-written batch of prompts. A campaign is a parameterized template in
`plan/campaigns/<name>.yaml`: repo selector, recon prompt template, implement prompt template,
**acceptance formula as a measurable delta against ledger/CI baselines** (coverage +N%, dup-budget
−N%, complexity ceiling −N, zero new deps with known CVEs), per-repo budget, priority.
The Architect instantiates it into ordinary tasks.yaml entries (per-repo recon → per-repo
implement), so campaigns inherit every existing guard — provenance gate, principles, two-strikes,
merge serialization — for free, and close with a campaign retro.

**v1 catalog**: tech-debt sweep · coverage-raise (ratchet bump) · dup-shrink / design-refactor pass
· dependency shepherding · doc-sync · security audit sweep · **platform-bump** (Claude Code/SDK
version — WS-7's release watcher feeds it). **Triggers**: standing (idle-groom now
drains low-priority campaign tasks before drafting new plan increments), scheduled (weekly
tech-debt hour in quiet-hours), and **retro-filed** (a retro finding that spans repos becomes a
campaign proposal on the plan-PR path). The principles engine (§5) is the fuel gauge: ratchets and
budgets provide the baselines campaigns move.

**REFACTOR — a first-class campaign type with TEETH (promoted; the operator correctly flagged it as
under-built).** "tech-debt sweep" was a vibe; it is now a real gated campaign whose acceptance FORMULA is a
MEASURABLE DELTA on the Tier-2/3 gates (§5): **mutation score UP · cyclomatic complexity DOWN · duplication
(jscpd) DOWN · ZERO new CVEs · every in-scope dependency-cruiser fitness violation RESOLVED.** A refactor PR
that does not move those numbers in the right direction is **CI-red** — refactor is proven by the gates, not
asserted. This is also the `refactor` skill (§5B); the campaign is how it runs fleet-wide (W2-T3).

## 4. Autonomy doctrine

**The loop never waits on a human unless the plan says `verify: human`.**

- **Auto-choose**: DECISION_REQUESTs resolve to the RECOMMENDED option (Promptsmith may override with
  stated reasoning); logged to `DECISIONS.md` with rationale + rollback pointer (usually "revert PR#N").
  Sound because the PR boundary makes nearly everything reversible.
- **Hard-stop list** (deterministic, tiny): destructive ops against live data stores; spend beyond cap;
  force-push; secret handling; anything not PR-shaped. Only these pause for the human.
- **Permissions**: workers run bypassPermissions (Craig's instance). Floor = PreToolUse deny-hook
  (<1s, exit 2): protected paths + `git push --force` + `gh auth` mutation. Documented to block even
  under bypass; **known counter-report** (claude-code#20946, macOS async race) ⇒ Phase-0 planted-probe
  test is the falsifier. Fallback if probe fails: `dontAsk` + allowlist (identical zero-stall).
  **Zero ask rules in worker settings** (ask rules still prompt under bypass ⇒ hung headless worker).
  Verify in Phase 0: git commit/push via Bash doesn't trip protected-path prompts (.git/ etc.).
- **Loop hardening**: transient-vs-strike classification (SynthWatch pattern — network/gh-5xx/CI-flake
  retries with backoff, no strike); stuck-PR shepherd (auto-rebase, auto-fix from failing logs,
  auto-resolve conflicts via resumed session); timeouts resolve to action; **idle = groom** (promote
  banked items, shepherd dependabot, triage flakes, draft next plan increment as a plan-repo PR).
- **Interrupts collapse to a daily digest**; real-time pings only for MANUAL + hard-stop.
- **Escalation taxonomy** (GitHub issues, `needs-human` label, options + recommendation in body):
  BLOCKED (post-diagnose), MANUAL (secrets, repo creation, deploys, eyeball/playtest gates),
  HARD-STOP, PLAN (approval PRs for new plans/increments). DECISION and DIRECTION classes are
  absorbed by auto-choose and idle-groom respectively. **ASYNC-QUESTION** is deliberately NOT an
  escalation: it never blocks (see QUESTION contract, §2). The MANUAL queue doubles as **the
  human's to-do list** — rendered in the control panel with check-off (= closing the issue), so the
  agent's asks of Craig are as visible and workable as Craig's asks of the agent.

## 4A. Workspace containment (fleet-wide)

**Everything lives under one root** (`~/Remudero`, configurable `REMUDERO_ROOT`); the main agent
works inside it and cannot leave; workers get subfolders (worktrees) within it.

Layout: `$ROOT/projects/<product>/{repos,worktrees/<task-id>}` · `$ROOT/state` (ledger, queues) ·
`$ROOT/logs` · `$ROOT/tmp`.

**Workers — OS-enforced (Claude Code native sandbox; macOS Seatbelt, nothing to install)**: default
write scope is the working directory + session $TMPDIR, enforced by the OS on every Bash command
and all child processes — a worker with cwd = its worktree is confined by the kernel, not by trust.
Worker settings ship: `sandbox: { enabled: true, failIfUnavailable: true` (never silently
unsandboxed)`, filesystem: { denyRead: [~/.ssh/**, ~/.aws/**, ~/.config/remudero/**] },
allowedDomains: [github.com, api.github.com, codeload.github.com, registry.npmjs.org` + per-repo
profile additions`], excludedCommands: ["gh *"] }` — gh is documented to fail TLS verification
under Seatbelt, so it runs outside the sandbox (still inside bypass + deny-hook, carrying only the
scoped PAT). Spike verifies whether plain `git push` over HTTPS works through the sandbox proxy;
record which path won. **Both layers for secrets**: sandbox denyRead governs Bash/`cat` but does
NOT stop the Read tool — permission `deny: Read(...)` rules cover the same paths. Zero ask rules
stays load-bearing: content-scoped ask rules (e.g. `Bash(git push *)`) still prompt even for
sandboxed commands. The sandbox auto-denies writes to its own settings files.

**Defense-in-depth stack, named**: bypassPermissions (gate 1 off, per directive) → OS sandbox
(gate 2 ON: what a command can touch) → PreToolUse deny-hook (deterministic tripwire) → scoped PAT
(blast-radius cap). The earlier "bypass is for isolated environments" tension resolves the
documented way: bypass + sandbox is the pairing.

**Main agent (daemon)**: plain node process, no LLM tools — containment is a code-level path guard
(every filesystem op derives from $ROOT; ops outside throw; unit-tested + a golden task). If the
Architect ever grows local tools (in-harness grill-me recon), those run as sandboxed workers too.

**Spike verdict 7 (containment probe)**: a sandboxed bypass worker (i) writes inside its worktree;
(ii) is OS-DENIED writing to a sibling path outside cwd (proof: error text + file absent);
(iii) completes a push with ZERO prompts under pre-configured allowedDomains; (iv) the
FORBIDDEN_PROBE hook-block still fires through the sandbox. Fallback if sandbox can't run
prompt-free headless: containment via hook-only, recorded honestly in FINDINGS as the weaker floor.

## 4B. Flight control (in-flight supervision, risk-graded gates, on-demand review)

**Why.** Today's only guards are terminal cliffs — budget, turns, strikes. They catch a worker
*after* it burns its budget, not *while* it goes wrong (FIELD FINDING 12 is the first such case: the
spawn race was caught by a cliff, post-burn). Flight control adds in-flight supervision, risk-graded
human gates, and on-demand specialist review — **without** putting an LLM in the merge decision. The
governing split: **supervision is deterministic; judgment is advisory. An LLM may recommend a halt;
only code may enforce one** (Standing rule 12).

**LAYER 1 — deterministic flight signals (no LLM).** Streamed per turn from the worker's stream-json,
computed by the control plane as pure **predicates** — they FIRE, they never JUDGE:
- **burn rate** vs. the task-type baseline (spend/turn against the mount's expectation);
- **diff-growth per turn** (a diff ballooning turn-over-turn);
- **repeated tool-call hashes** (the same call issued again and again);
- **error-signature loops** — count only occurrence **N ≥ 3** of a fingerprinted error (the
  analyze-diagnostics discipline: one failure is noise, three is a loop);
- **scope drift** — files touched vs. the task's declared files;
- **stall timeout** — no progress within a wall-clock bound.
These are cheap, deterministic tripwires. A trip does not decide anything; it *invokes Layer 2*.

**LAYER 2 — the FLIGHT JUDGE (LLM-as-judge on PROCESS, not artifact).** Invoked **ONLY** on a Layer-1
tripwire (never resident per turn). **FRESH context.** It sees: the goal, the acceptance criteria,
and the last N turns' **tool calls AND results** — **never the worker's reasoning** (the maker sees
its own trail; the verifier sees only behavior + rubric, so it cannot be talked into agreement by the
maker's narrative). It returns:
`{ state: productive | converging | spiraling | blocked | off_track, evidence[],
recommendation: continue | nudge | halt_and_diagnose | escalate, confidence }`.
It **ADVISES**; a **deterministic controller ACTS** on the advice:
- `spiraling` + high confidence → **halt + dispatch a DIAGNOSE worker** (never a third blind patch,
  Standing rule 5);
- `off_track` → **halt + escalate**;
- `converging` → **raise the tripped threshold ONCE, log it, continue** (slow ≠ stuck).
The judge **rides a HIGHER tier than the worker** (G-17 Tier Invariant). It is **capped at K
invocations per run; the Kth must DECIDE, not defer** (no infinite advisory loop). The judge **NEVER
edits code and NEVER merges.**

**LAYER 3 — RISK SCORING (this is what makes auto-choose SAFE — not a retraction of it).**
Deterministic, computed from the diff + task metadata:
- **blast_radius** — does it touch hooks / settings / env / CI / branch protection / credentials /
  new dependencies / network egress?
- **reversibility** — how cleanly does `revert PR#N` undo it?
- **novelty** — first-of-kind change vs. well-trodden path;
- **confidence** — reviewer score, strike count, flight-judge state.
Bands and their gates:
- **low → auto-choose, unchanged** — the overwhelming default (§4 autonomy stands);
- **medium → reviewer PASS required** — the gate already enforces this (Standing rule 3B);
- **high → the DECISION_REQUEST becomes a TIMEBOXED QUESTION** with the assumption stated; **unanswered
  at timeout ⇒ take the recommendation and flag it LOUDLY in the digest** (still no stall — §4);
- **critical → HARD STOP + escalate, never auto-chosen.** The existing hard-stop list (§4) is the
  FLOOR, not the ceiling.

**LAYER 4 — the SPECIALIST PANEL: consult, don't committee.** Triggered **BY risk + diff signals**,
never resident on every task (cost + slop). Each specialist gets **fresh context, read-only tools, a
scoped rubric**; posts **PR review comments** and contributes to the reviewer's verdict:
- **security** ← auth / credentials / egress / new deps / hooks / settings;
- **testing** ← `tdd: strict`, or a negative coverage/mutation delta, or new code paths without tests;
- **design** ← the diff crosses layer boundaries (fitness rules) or adds an abstraction;
- **containment** ← ANY diff touching sandbox / settings / deny-floor / env (WS-0 proved a typo there
  silently drops containment — FIELD FINDING 10a).
Specialists **ADVISE**; the **GitHub-enforced gate DECIDES** (Standing rule 3B).

**FORBIDDEN.** No standing committee (panels are triggered, not resident). **No LLM in the merge
decision** — the merge gate is a GitHub-enforced contract, always. No judge-of-the-judge recursion
(the K-cap terminates advice). Judges and specialists **never edit code.**

**Build order.** Layer 1 = **W1-T20**, Layer 2 = **W1-T21**, Layer 3 = **W1-T22** (T20→T21→T22, all
after the enforced gate W1-T1D); Layer 4 = **W2-T1** (after the reviewer W1-T1D + risk scoring W1-T22).

## 5. Principles engine

Remudero's CI today is typecheck + tests. That is the FLOOR, not the bar. The operator's fleet
(SynthWatch, neon-drift, rogue-descent, wild-trails, OleyArcade, ClawApp) paid — sometimes in outages —
for a gate stack Remudero must both MEET on itself and INHERIT-by-default onto every project it builds
(§5A). A harness that ships untested, unscanned code at scale is a liability generator; the anti-slop
thesis of §Mission is only real if the gates are real. Structure: **three ENFORCEMENT layers (how)** over
**a three-TIER gate stack (what)**.

### Enforcement layers (strongest first — instructions shape behavior; gates guarantee it)

1. **Deterministic gates** (hooks + CI) — the load-bearing layer. Trust/pass-fail is a DETERMINISTIC
   predicate, never an LLM decision (Standing rule 2). TDD Guard-style PreToolUse enforcement (blocks
   implementation edits without a failing test) where the stack supports it; `tdd: strict` REPORTs paste
   **red→green proof**. Everything in the tier stack below is enforced here or by the reviewer.
2. **Reviewer rubric** (judgment — advises; the GitHub-enforced gate decides, Standing rule 3B). Rubric
   items, each a checked question: **one concern per PR**; **all callers audited** (partial-fix drift —
   a change that fixes one call site and orphans the rest); **test theater** (assertions that assert
   nothing / snapshots-of-nothing / tests that kill no mutants); **refactor-phase honesty** (a "refactor"
   that changes behavior); coupling/cohesion; **no worker-authored `satisfied_by`** (a diff that ADDS a
   `satisfied_by` line to `plan/tasks.yaml` FAILS unless the PR is plan-only and human-authored —
   `satisfied_by` is Architect-only; a worker adding it to its own blocking criterion is editing the
   criteria to match the diff, Standing rule 15). TDD Guard's own author documented that mechanical
   test-first alone still yielded tight coupling + duplication — which is why layer 2 exists.
3. **Prompt layer**: Promptsmith injects the repo's principles profile into every prompt; weakest,
   never load-bearing.

### The gate stack — three tiers

**TIER 1 — SECURITY (must-have, day one).**
- **CodeQL** via an EXPLICIT workflow — GitHub's *default setup* must be **DISABLED**, or the two
  conflict and both go unreliable (fleet lesson). [LEARNINGS]
- **Dependency scanning (Dependabot)** — **MAJOR bumps are EXCLUDED from auto-merge at the dep-review LANE
  (W1-T54), NOT via Dependabot ignore-rules.** ★ FLEET FINDING (rule-7 verify, this sweep): the installed
  fleet dependabot configs are **IGNORE-FREE** — synthwatch `.github/dependabot.yml` carries only
  minor+patch GROUPING (`update-types: [minor, patch]`, to collapse PRs), NO `ignore:` block; neon-drift's
  documents "NO ignore list" deliberately. And the fleet's auto-merge does **no semver check**: synthwatch
  `claude-review.yml` `automerge` fires for any trusted author incl `dependabot[bot]` (majors would
  auto-merge today); neon-drift SKIPS dependabot entirely. So the earlier "Dependabot ignore-rules for
  semver-major" was ASPIRATIONAL, not installed. Remudero's real mechanism: ignore-free Dependabot +
  minor/patch grouping, with the semver level parsed at the dep-review lane — minor/patch auto-merge,
  majors escalate to a human (the 28-minute-outage lesson enforced in CODE, not config).
- **OSV / vulnerability scan** on the dependency tree (catches advisories Dependabot hasn't cut a bump
  for yet).
- **Secret scanning + PUSH PROTECTION** — already live on `remudero` (FIELD FINDING 8); required on
  every provisioned repo.
- **SECURITY.md** with a private-disclosure path (advisories, not public issues).
- **Least-privilege `GITHUB_TOKEN`** — every workflow declares minimal `permissions:` (default read-all
  is a standing over-grant).
- **Pinned action SHAs, never tags** — `uses: org/action@<40-char-sha>`; a moved tag is a supply-chain
  vector.
- **No plaintext secrets in any tree** — a leak-grep runs **in CI on every PR**, not just once in the
  spike; push protection is the backstop, the grep is the tripwire.
- **★ AGENT-SPECIFIC (we ship an agent harness, so the diff itself is attack surface):**
  - **Prompt-injection surface review** — REQUIRED on any diff touching worker **prompts, hooks,
    settings, or egress** (a poisoned prompt/hook is a code-exec path).
  - **Containment probe as a REQUIRED check** — on any diff touching **sandbox / deny-floor / env** (WS-0
    FF10a proved a single typo there SILENTLY drops containment; static validation is not enough — the
    probe is the empirical guarantee, W1-T2 / W1-T28).

**TIER 2 — QUALITY & TESTING.**
- **Coverage ratchet** — never down; ratchets up. A coverage-lowering PR is CI-red. Baseline captured at
  onboarding so the ratchet has a floor.
- **Mutation-testing baseline** — Stryker for TS (SynthWatch pattern). **Green tests that kill no mutants
  are theater;** the mutation score is the falsifier that coverage % cannot provide. Baseline recorded,
  ratcheted like coverage.
- **Duplication budget** — jscpd threshold; breach ⇒ CI-red + auto-filed refactor task (idle-groom).
- **Complexity budgets** — eslint `complexity` + `max-lines`/`max-lines-per-function`, advisory-then-
  required per profile.
- **TypeScript strict — VERIFIED ACTIVE, not assumed.** A planted probe (the neon-drift `_probe(x)`
  lesson) must FAIL the gate: *"0 violations" from a fresh strict gate is suspicious until falsified.*

**TIER 3 — ARCHITECTURE / MAINTAINABILITY.**
- **Fitness functions via dependency-cruiser** — the games' purity gates generalized into declarable
  layering rules: "src/game imports no Three.js" → for remudero, **"src/lib imports nothing from
  spike/CLI"** (`src/lib` must not import `src/spike.ts` or `src/run-task.ts`). A violating import is
  CI-red.
- **ADR discipline** for IRREVERSIBLE calls (a short Architecture Decision Record accompanies a
  one-way-door change; reversible PR-shaped changes stay in `DECISIONS.md`/auto-choose).
- **One-concern-per-PR** — socially enforced today; made a reviewer-rubric item (layer 2) so it is
  checked, not hoped.

### CI mechanics (fleet-hardened — these are RULES, learned in production)

- **The required-check context is the JOB NAME, not the workflow file name.** Protection keys on the job.
- **A conditionally-SKIPPED required check DEADLOCKS merge forever** (a `paths:`-filtered or `if:`-gated
  job that doesn't run is "expected, pending" = never green). ⇒ **use ONE always-runs CI-GATE AGGREGATOR
  job** that `needs:` every sub-job and succeeds only if all did; make THAT the single required context
  (W1-T24). Sub-jobs may skip freely; the aggregator always reports.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN` suppresses downstream workflow triggers** — a workflow's push/PR events won't fire
  another workflow when authored by the default token; use an app/PAT where a chained trigger is needed.
- **Arm `--auto` under protection; never immediate-merge** — an immediate merge RACES the checks
  (Standing rule 3B: GitHub decides on green, the runner only arms + observes).
- **Trust is a deterministic predicate, never an LLM decision** (Standing rule 2) — the reviewer/judge
  ADVISE; only the aggregator + protection ENFORCE.

### Per-repo profile — `.remudero/principles.yaml`

Declares the tier config for a repo: `tdd`, `coverage_ratchet`, `mutation_baseline`, `dup_threshold`,
`complexity`, `fitness_rules[]`, `security_profile`. OSS users tune; Promptsmith reads; CI enforces;
reviewer audits; plan tasks may override per task. Profiles by project type (`ts-node` / `ts-web` /
`python` / `dotnet`) ship sane defaults — the operator tunes but NEVER starts from zero (§5A).

**REMUDERO RUNS THE STRICTEST PROFILE ON ITSELF** — `tdd: strict`, ratchet on, mutation baseline,
fitness rules, the full security tier. The harness eats first: every gate is proven GREEN (and proven to
FAIL a planted violation) on Remudero's own codebase before it is inflicted on anyone else's.

## 5A. The fleet bar is inherited, not optional

Meeting the bar on `remudero` is necessary but not the point. The point is that **every project Remudero
orchestrates INHERITS the bar automatically** — provisioned at onboarding, not asked to adopt it. A
harness that builds code at fleet scale without installing the gates is a liability generator; opt-in
quality is quality that silently doesn't happen.

**`rmd project init <repo>`** (W1-T27) is the onboarding primitive. Given a target repo it scaffolds, in
one PR against that repo:
- the **workflows** (CodeQL explicit, OSV, leak-grep, coverage/mutation/jscpd/complexity, the CI-gate
  **aggregator** job) — SHA-pinned, least-privilege;
- the **configs** (`dependabot.yml` with majors excluded, dependency-cruiser rules, eslint/tsconfig
  strict, `.remudero/principles.yaml` for the chosen profile);
- **`SECURITY.md`** + private disclosure;
- **branch protection** wired to require the single aggregator context (+ secret-scanning/push-protection
  on);
- **ratchet BASELINES captured at onboarding** (coverage %, mutation score, dup %, complexity) so every
  ratchet has a real floor from day one — a repo never onboards "at zero."

**Profiles** (`ts-node`, `ts-web`, `python`, `dotnet`) carry the sane defaults; the operator tunes
`.remudero/principles.yaml`, never authors the stack from scratch. **A campaign (§3A) raises the bar
fleet-wide** when a gate improves: the improved gate becomes a per-repo task, instantiated across the
selector, each with its own baseline capture and green-PR proof.

The invariant: **Remudero runs the strictest profile on itself, and no project it touches runs less than
its profile's floor.** The harness never ships a gate it hasn't already eaten.

## 5B. The Architect-worker primitive & the skill registry

**OBSERVATION (the unification):** Setup, Plan, Refine, Expand, Feedback/triage, Refactor, Design Review,
Retro, and the Reviewer are ALL THE SAME PRIMITIVE — a **higher-tier (G-17) worker** that **GROUNDS** (grep
the plan / learnings / ledger / DECISIONS for what is already decided) → **RESEARCHES** (server-side
WebSearch) → **GRILLS** (AskUserQuestion / a `needs-human` issue, §4/§7B) or **PRODUCES** (a PR gated by
`ci + remudero-review`). They differ ONLY in a declarative PROFILE. So they are not nine features to build
nine times; they are ONE primitive plus a registry of configs.

**The skill registry** — `.remudero/skills/<name>.yaml`:
`{ tools[], permission_profile, output_contract, grounding_sources[], gate, tier }`. **Adding a skill is a
CONFIG ENTRY, not new code** (W1-T44). Each skill maps 1:1 to a future UI action (§7 shell, W3-T8) — the
panel button IS the registry entry.

**The registry (v1):**
- **setup** → the Setup Agent (WS-4 / G-16), unchanged — folded in as a skill.
- **plan** → ★ **ONE skill, THREE MODES**: `create | clarify | expand`. **Refine = clarify; Expand =
  expand.** The operator's "Refine is maybe a duplicate of Plan" is CORRECT — do NOT build three skills
  that triplicate ground→research→grill→propose and drift apart. `rmd plan --mode=create|clarify|expand`
  (W1-T45).
- **feedback / triage** → §7B, folded in.
- **retro** → the existing retro Architect (`rmd retro`), folded in.
- **review** → the DETERMINISTIC-gated reviewer (the judge is code — Standing rule 2/§7A; the LLM layer is
  advisory only), folded in.
- **refactor** → PROMOTED to a first-class skill + campaign with teeth (§3A, W2-T3).
- **design-review** → NEW, with its own hardened browser profile (§7C, W3-T7).

**TOOL BOUNDARY stays PER-PROFILE, never global:** the web tools (WebSearch/WebFetch) and browser egress
are granted PER SKILL (§7B, §7C) — an implement worker's profile grants none of them. A skill can PROPOSE
anything and MERGE nothing; every output is contained by the same PR + review gate as any worker.

## 5C. Task pre-flight: the plan gate

**Task quality is a GATED, LEARNED property — caught BEFORE dispatch by a deterministic linter, refined by
the Architect, and continuously re-graded by the retro. The runner is the LAST line of defense, not the
first.** Four malformed tasks reached workers and burned budget before a human noticed the pattern (W1-T6,
W1-T9, and W1-T12 — which violated Rules 18 and 19 three times over). Every one was catchable *before*
dispatch. Reactive diagnosis after an 81-turn / $10 burn is the anti-pattern this project exists to kill;
task quality moves UPSTREAM of the runner and the plan LEARNS from overruns automatically.

**LAYER A — the DETERMINISTIC task linter (no LLM), run at TWO points, FAIL-CLOSED:** (i) a CI check on any
PR that edits `plan/tasks.yaml`; (ii) a PRE-DISPATCH guard in `rmd run-task` / `rmd drain` — a task that
fails the linter is NEVER dispatched (`verdict=blocked_illformed`), so a broken task can never reach a
worker again. It checks, all from rules we already wrote:
- **SIZING (Rule 19):** count acceptance criteria; count distinct subsystems implied by `files:` / the
  criteria. ≥2 concerns or ≥2 subsystems while `risk < high` ⇒ FLAG (raise to high or decompose).
- **HEADLESS-FITNESS (Rule 18):** grep each criterion against a forbidden live-context LEXICON —
  `overnight` · `reboot` · `launchctl` · "loads at boot" · `killed` · "operator confirms" · "user selects"
  · manual-eyeball — on a `type:implement` (auto-verify) task ⇒ FLAG (move to `verify:human` or redesign the
  criterion for headless verification). The lexicon is DATA, so it grows.
- **PROOF-SHAPE:** every criterion has an OBSERVABLE proof (not "works" / "correct" / a vibe) ⇒ else FLAG.
- **PROVENANCE (Rules 16/17):** `origin:` + `risk:` present ⇒ else FLAG.
- **BUDGET SANITY (soft):** flag a task whose `risk→mount` turn-budget is below the observed mean for its
  class (ledger calibration) — a WARNING, not a block.

**LAYER B — Architect review (LLM), only for what the linter CAN'T judge.** Invoked on NEW tasks a plan PR
adds, it grounds (grep `plan/learnings`) and asks the judgment questions the linter can't — "is this
genuinely ONE concern?", "is any criterion secretly a task-inside-a-task?", "does a learning already warn
about this?". ADVISORY: it annotates the task with a risk/rationale; it does NOT block (the linter blocks).
Reuses the §5B Architect-worker primitive. **Most catches are DETERMINISTIC** — criteria count, subsystem
count, forbidden verbs, proof-shape need no LLM; reserve Layer B for genuine ambiguity. Cheap checks first.

**The retro's PLAN-HEALTH duties (the "learn as we go" half).** `rmd retro`, every run, must:
- **RE-GRADE** every OPEN task against every standing rule — the forward-only gap that let W1-T12 slip
  (Standing rule 20). Emit a plan-health report; auto-file a corrective task per violation.
- **MINE** `max_turns` / `blocked_*` verdicts for PATTERNS: if a CLASS of task overruns (cross-cutting
  implement tasks — W1-T6, W1-T9, W1-T12 all did), propose a CLASS-level fix (adjust the mount, or a new
  auto-risk rule like "touches ≥3 files ⇒ `risk:high`"), NOT another per-task patch.
- **RUN the Layer-A linter across the WHOLE open queue** and surface every current violation.

Layer A = W1-T20c (linter + fail-closed guard); the retro plan-health sweep = W1-T20d.

## 5D. Fleet operations — the ongoing-response loop

**Provisioning the gate stack (§5/§5A) is ONE-TIME; OPERATING it is CONTINUOUS.** Setting up CodeQL/OSV/
Semgrep/Scorecard/Dependabot on a repo is done once; the alerts and dependency PRs they generate arrive
forever and, until now, nothing responded to them. The harness owns **three intake lanes**, all
PR/issue-shaped, all gated by the same [ci, remudero-review] gate as any task:

1. **Dependency PRs** (W1-T54) — a Dependabot PR is UNMERGEABLE today (nothing posts remudero-review on a
   non-task PR: fail-closed but frozen). A deterministic dep-review lane posts remudero-review + arms
   auto-merge for minor/patch, and ESCALATES majors (needs-human, no auto-merge). This is where MAJOR
   exclusion lives — in code, not Dependabot ignore-rules (§5 FLEET FINDING).
2. **Scanner alerts** (W1-T55 surface → W1-T56 triage) — code-scanning / Dependabot / secret-scanning
   alerts for the managed repo set land in the daily digest (counts + ages); new critical/high escalate.
3. **Repo ISSUES on MANAGED repos** (W1-T57) — open issues become feedback artifacts on a schedule,
   deduped, triaged; the digest carries an issues-reviewed count so "reviewed regularly" is a LEDGERED
   fact, not an intention.

**Alerts and issues are MACHINE-ORIGIN FEEDBACK** — they flow through the **§7B feedback inbox**
(`origin: alert#<id>` / `origin: issue#<n>`) and are triaged by `rmd triage` (W1-T41) into corrective
tasks, NOT a parallel loop. One inbox, one triage discipline, whatever the source.

**★ G-6 (operator standing decision):** remudero's OWN public issues stay **OFF** until WS-4. Flipping that
is the operator's call, not the harness's; W1-T57 covers issues on repos the harness MANAGES, not
remudero's own public tracker.

## 6. Open-source packaging

- **License**: Apache-2.0 (patent grant, enterprise-friendly). D-2.
- **Distribution**: npm — `npx remudero init` scaffolds `.remudero/` (config, principles.yaml, deny-floor
  hook, worker settings with zero ask rules) via a **first-run wizard**: tier auto-detect→confirm
  (§9 ladder), thinking posture, metering regime, quiet hours, permission profile, notifier, + optional fleet CI templates (claude-review + trusted-
  author auto-merge with base==main gate, ci-gate aggregator). Daemon: `remudero up` (launchd/systemd
  units generated). macOS + Linux; Windows via WSL note.
- **Config abstraction**: adapters for notify (ntfy/slack/discord/email/webhook/imessage), VCS
  (GitHub first; interface leaves room), model routing. No hardcoded accounts, ports, or paths.
- **Permission profiles**: `standard` (dontAsk + curated allowlist + deny-floor) — **OSS default**;
  `yolo` (bypassPermissions + deny-floor) — opt-in, documented with the honest tradeoffs. Craig's
  instance runs yolo. Shipping yolo as default would be indefensible for strangers' machines. D-4.
- **Auth stance**: works on Claude Code subscription OAuth today (programmatic usage draws from
  subscription limits; the separate Agent SDK credit pool was paused 2026-06-15 — re-verify at each
  release); API-key path documented for heavy/steady-state users. MeterGuard reads total_cost_usd
  per run regardless of billing mode.
- **Build-in-the-open hygiene (G-1)**: public from day 1 ⇒ LICENSE + README stub + .gitignore land
  in PR #1; instance specifics (accounts, hosts, protected-path lists, notifier config) live only in
  the gitignored `local/` overlay; committed docs and FINDINGS redact hostnames/IPs; secrets never
  enter the tree (PAT lives outside the repo); a leak-grep is part of spike acceptance.
- **Security disclosure**: honest README section — unattended agents + Bash = prompt-injection surface
  via deps/web; scoped fine-grained PAT per product (never account-wide login in workers); deny-floor
  is a tripwire, not a sandbox; pointer to OS sandboxing for the paranoid.
- **Positioning under platform risk**: if Anthropic ships native plan-stewardship, this project's
  provenance/verdicting/principles layer is deliberately user-land glue over Claude Code primitives —
  it rides platform improvements rather than competing with them; building in the open makes pivots
  legible rather than fatal.
- **Open-core stance (D-8)**: everything required to run the full loop locally — daemon, CLI,
  containment, principles engine, single-project control panel, MCP, retros/knowledge system, the
  public commons — is **Apache-2.0 forever**. Pro candidates (post-traction, not before WS-6):
  hosted relay/sync for mobile push without self-managed tailnet, multi-project portfolio views,
  team/multi-operator seats, hosted question inbox, **hosted org-brain sync** (private
  cross-project knowledge, §Self-improvement). Commitment for community trust: **nothing open ever
  moves behind the paywall**; Pro lives in a separate repo so DCO contributions to core never need
  relicensing.
- **Public support posture (G-6 RESOLVED)**: README carries a pre-alpha banner ("APIs and files
  change without notice; issues/PRs may not receive responses"); **Issues and Discussions OFF until
  WS-4**, then open with templates + DCO sign-off; CODEOWNERS from PR #1.
- **Dogfooding**: from WS-1 on, Remudero builds Remudero — this repo runs its own harness.
- **Out of scope v1**: non-GitHub forges, Windows-native, multi-tenant server, non-Claude agents.

## 6A. Open-source governance & the commercial boundary

Not legal advice; a qualified attorney reviews this before any money changes hands. Sourced from
open-core practice (OCV, TermsFeed, FINOS) 2026-07-14.

**Contribution model: DCO, not CLA — and the door is closed deliberately.** Open core does NOT
require a CLA: contributions to the core stay under Apache-2.0 and are never relicensed; only the
proprietary components need consolidated ownership. DCO is the low-friction, community-aligned norm
(GitLab moved CLA→DCO in 2017 under community pressure). **One-way door, accepted knowingly**: a DCO
likely cannot support a later relicense (its grant is tied to the license in effect at contribution
time), so the BSL/SSPL escape hatch Elastic/Redis/MongoDB used is CLOSED to us. That is the point —
each of those relicensings cost enormous trust, and D-8 already forbids paywalling anything open.
**We publish the never-relicense commitment as a CONTRACT (README + GOVERNANCE.md), not an internal
note.** Reversing this requires a CLA from day one; retrofitting is effectively impossible.

**No crippled core (named anti-pattern).** Best practice explicitly warns against withholding
essential features from the open version to manufacture paid dependency. **The open core must deliver
complete, uncompromised utility for its scope**: the full loop — daemon, CLI, containment, principles
engine, retros/knowledge, campaigns, single-project control panel, MCP, public commons — is free
forever. Pro may only ever be *hosted convenience* (relay/sync, portfolio views, team seats, org-brain
sync), never a capability amputated from core.

**Extension seam (ENGINEERING REQUIREMENT, WS-4 — currently missing).** Open-core designs need
abstraction layers so proprietary modules load/unload without destabilizing or forking the core.
Remudero's adapter boundaries — notifier, VCS, storage, auth/identity, model routing — become
**first-class plugin interfaces with a stable contract BEFORE any Pro code exists.** Pro must attach,
never fork. If Pro ever needs a core change, that change lands in core, open.

**Trademark is the control lever, not the license.** Apache-2.0 gives the code away; the NAME stays
ours and is the only real protection (cf. the WordPress/WP Engine dispute). Ship `TRADEMARK.md`
(what "Remudero" may/may not be used for); file the wordmark when there's traction. Domains already held.

**Governance: BDFL.** GOVERNANCE.md states it plainly — the roadmap is the maintainer's, PRs welcome,
CODEOWNERS enforces review. Prevents fork drama and sets honest expectations.

**Required doc set (WS-4)**: LICENSE (Apache-2.0) ✓ · NOTICE · CONTRIBUTING.md (DCO sign-off, one
concern per PR, proofs-as-acceptance) · CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md · **SECURITY.md — non-negotiable here**:
threat model (unattended agents + Bash + bypass; prompt-injection via deps/web/repo content), the
containment stack, and a private disclosure process · GOVERNANCE.md · TRADEMARK.md · CHANGELOG.md
(keep-a-changelog + semver) · issue/PR templates · third-party license inventory.

**Published promises (README, testable, not marketing):** no telemetry, ever — knowledge reaches the
commons ONLY via human-gated PRs · nothing open ever moves behind the paywall · operators run on
their own subscription per Anthropic's terms (one operator, one account, one machine; the harness is
a tool for your seat, not a seat-multiplier).

## 7A. The API contract is the product boundary

**This is the crux, and it is logically PRIOR to every client below.** Three clients (dashboard,
desktop, mobile) plus MCP all talk to one daemon; a daemon with no COMPILE-TIME contract lets them drift,
and three-clients-drifting-from-a-daemon is runtime breakage no gate catches. So the contract comes first.

- The daemon exposes **ONE tailnet service surface** — REST + SSE, single port, **bearer-scoped**
  (read vs. write). No client gets a private backdoor.
- **`packages/api-client` is GENERATED from that surface** and is the ONLY way any client talks to the
  daemon. **Generator choice: OpenAPI → typed client** (over hand-written TS types) — justification: the
  daemon is the single source of truth, OpenAPI is language-agnostic (a future non-TS client or an
  external integrator generates the same client), and the spec doubles as public API docs on the site
  (WS-12); TS-types-only would re-encode the surface by hand, the exact drift this section exists to kill.
- **Rules (each a CI-enforced or ADR-gated invariant):**
  - **No client may hand-roll a `fetch`** to the daemon — a grep gate fails the build (W3-T1).
  - **A breaking contract change must fail CI in EVERY consumer in the SAME PR** — this is the whole
    reason the clients live in one repo (D-5). Drift cannot ship.
  - **The contract is semver'd; a breaking change requires an ADR** (§5 Tier 3 discipline).
  - **MCP tools are a PROJECTION of the same contract, never a parallel API** — `plan.read`,
    `escalations.answer`, etc. call the api-client, not a second surface.
- **Rationale:** the plan already calls clients "stateless projections" (§7). This is what makes that
  true IN CODE rather than in prose — the projection is generated, versioned, and gated, so a client
  cannot silently diverge from the daemon it renders.

## 7. The control panel — ONE web app, three shells

**Every client here is a PROJECTION of the API contract (§7A) — no client talks to the daemon any other
way.** The panel is the operator's cockpit: see the plan; work the **human to-do list** (MANUAL queue
with check-off); answer the **question backlog** in batches (QUESTION contract, §2 — answers flow to the
Architect, corrective tasks auto-file when a shipped assumption was wrong); submit **feedback** the
Architect triages into plan edits/tasks; watch **fleet status** (per-worker state, current task, live
stream tails); **Pause/Resume** (drain-and-hold) and **STOP**; quiet-hours toggle; cost meter. Question
store: `plan/questions.ndjson` (durable, diffable), surfaced in clients + the daily digest count.

**ONE web app, three shells.** The panel is data-dense web (DAG, diffs, live stream tails, cost charts).
It is built ONCE as a web app; the **same web build is the SAME artifact in every shell**, wrapped three
ways:

- **SHELL 0 — browser (WS-5a → W3-T2).** The web app served by the daemon over Tailscale. Works on Mac
  AND phone **today**, zero new tooling. This is mobile posture **M0**.
- **SHELL 1 — Tauri macOS (W3-T3).** Wraps the same web build in a native shell: menu-bar presence,
  launch-at-login, native notifications, global hotkey, deep links. A **small delta** over shell 0 (the
  banked macOS one-liner, made real). Tauri binaries are **3–5 MB vs Electron ~150 MB** [research].
- **SHELL 2 — Tauri iOS (W3-T4, TIMEBOXED spike).** The same codebase again, rendered in **WKWebView**;
  App Store distribution; biometric unlock; deep links.

**Why not React Native / Expo for the panel:** the panel is web-native (DAG, diffs, live tails, charts)
and RNW fights all of it. **Expo is the DOCUMENTED FALLBACK for iOS** — Tauri's maintainers explicitly
say mobile is NOT a first-class citizen [research], so if the W3-T4 spike proves too rough, the operator's
deep Expo expertise makes the pivot cheap. **Trigger condition (a real fallback, not a footnote):** the
spike cannot get the web build running prompt-free on a device, OR App Store review rejects the WKWebView
shell ⇒ pivot the **iOS shell only** to Expo; shells 0 and 1 are unaffected.

**Push is an ADAPTER concern, not an APP concern.** Escalations already push via **GitHub-mobile (free,
today)**, ntfy, or iMessage (§8/WS-1). The app is for **ACTING** — answer, approve, STOP, watch — not for
alerting. This **decouples the app from the UNVERIFIED Tauri-APNs-remote-push question** [research]
entirely: no shell needs remote push to ship. **M1** (free at WS-1, before any shell exists): escalations
are GitHub issues ⇒ the GitHub mobile app already pushes them and accepts replies ⇒ remote
loop-continuation ships with the daemon MVP.

**Editing capability tiers** (orthogonal to the shells; whatever tier ships, all three shells inherit it):
- **read-only live board (WS-5a → W3-T2):** MASTER-PLAN render, task DAG with live states, worker stream
  tails (stream-json), DECISIONS feed, escalations inbox, question backlog, cost meter. Transport: daemon
  file-watch + SSE. Git stays the sole writer.
- **human-in-the-loop actions (W3-T5):** answer questions, approve MANUAL items, Pause/Resume/STOP,
  quiet-hours toggle — writes go through the api-client's write scope, ledgered with the panel's bearer.
- **in-UI plan editing (WS-5b):** single-writer, debounced plan-sync commits by the daemon; agents
  propose edits as plan-repo PRs rendered inline for one-click apply.
- **multi-writer (WS-6):** CRDT (Yjs) over the plan doc, checkpointed to git by the daemon (git remains
  truth). D-3 decides if it is worth it after living with in-UI editing.

**remudero-mcp (WS-6):** tools `plan.read`, `plan.propose_patch`, `task.add/update`, `runs.status`,
`escalations.list/answer` — a **projection of the same contract (§7A)**, never a parallel API. Exposed
over tailnet HTTPS → claude.ai custom connector; bearer token, read vs. write scopes.

## 7B. Feedback intake: the Architect's front door

Today the harness has **no front door**: every piece of operator feedback goes chat with an external
Architect → research → synthesis → a hand-pasted prompt → a plan PR. This is the last fully-manual loop.

**FEEDBACK IS AN ARTIFACT, NOT A COMMAND.** `plan/feedback/` is a durable, diffable inbox — one entry per
item: `{id, ts, raw text, attachments[] (multimodal — screenshots, terminal dumps, links), origin:
cli|ui|issue, status: new|grilling|proposed|accepted|rejected, proposal_pr}`. Captured async by
`rmd feedback` (W1-T40); never lost in a chat scrollback.

**THE INTAKE LOOP (`rmd triage`, W1-T41)** — an ARCHITECT worker, **HIGHER TIER than implement (G-17)**:
1. **GROUND** — grep the plan, learnings, ledger, and DECISIONS for what is ALREADY decided. Re-deciding a
   settled question is a failure mode, not a feature.
2. **RESEARCH** — server-side WebSearch for platform facts. This is what makes a proposal *grounded*
   rather than merely plausible.
3. **GRILL OR PROPOSE** —
   - **AMBIGUOUS ⇒ GRILL** (W1-T42). Interactive: `AskUserQuestion` at the terminal. Async: a `needs-human`
     GitHub issue with options + a recommendation — **reuse the existing escalation machinery (§4), do not
     invent a second one**. The grill is where the VALUE is; a triage that never asks anything is guessing.
   - **CLEAR ⇒ PROPOSE.** A plan-only PR naming which §sections change, which tasks are added/rewired, the
     rationale, and the **provenance back to the feedback id** (`origin: feedback#<id>`). Gated by
     `ci + remudero-review` like everything else.

**TOOL BOUNDARY (load-bearing):** the **Architect gets WebSearch/WebFetch; IMPLEMENT WORKERS NEVER DO** —
fetched content is a prompt-injection surface, and `claude-code-action` disables these by default for
exactly this reason [research]. WebSearch is server-side (Anthropic's), so the Architect researches
WITHOUT opening the sandbox's `allowedDomains`. The Architect's output is contained by the **same PR +
review gate** as any worker: it can **PROPOSE anything and MERGE nothing**.

**TRACEABILITY (`rmd trace`, W1-T43):** feedback → proposal PR → task(s) → run(s) → PR(s) → merge sha,
renderable both ways (forward from a feedback id, reverse from a task id), off the `origin:`/`plan_refs`
metadata (Standing rule 17). **HONEST LIMIT, stated:** v1 triage is WEAKER than a research-heavy chat with
an external Architect. The measurable calibration metric is **what fraction of proposal PRs are accepted
UNCHANGED** — track it; strategy, contested calls, and deep research stay a human/chat path until that
number earns trust.

## 7C. Design Review (the visual/UX skill)

The one genuinely-MISSING capability: an **Architect-tier skill that validates and improves UI/UX**. It is
the ONLY skill permitted browser egress, and it runs under HARD CONSTRAINTS (from research, non-negotiable):

- **Dedicated sandbox profile.** Runs under its OWN sandbox whose `allowedDomains` EXPLICITLY allowlists the
  browser/target domains it needs; every NORMAL worker keeps the locked list (github.com / npm only).
  Browser egress is a per-skill grant, never global (§5B). Playwright needs a real browser with network
  egress, so this profile — and only this profile — widens the allowlist [research].
- **Accessibility-tree first; screenshots on demand.** Uses Playwright MCP **ACCESSIBILITY-TREE snapshots**
  (2–5 KB structured YAML) for structure/assertions — **10–100× cheaper** than screenshots (500 KB–2 MB
  images) [research]. SCREENSHOTS only for artifacts a HUMAN must eyeball, and gated (they blow up token
  usage — request "only when necessary"). MCP is the SANDBOXED-client path; the Playwright CLI's compact
  YAML snapshots would be cheaper still but REQUIRE shell access, so MCP is chosen.
- **`browser_run_code_unsafe` is HARD-DENIED.** It runs arbitrary JS in the Playwright server —
  **RCE-equivalent, "only for trusted MCP clients,"** and a bypass-mode worker is not that [research].
- **Capabilities:** run Playwright E2E / visual flows, capture screenshots as PR artifacts, audit against
  WCAG/a11y + responsive breakpoints, research reference designs (WebSearch), and act as an expert UI/UX
  reviewer proposing concrete diffs. **Output:** a design-review report + screenshots ON THE PR; it
  PROPOSES, the gate DECIDES.
- **Human-eye verdicts route to `verify: human`** — the games' draft → playtest → ready flow: anything that
  needs a human to LOOK is not auto-verifiable. (W3-T7.)

## 8. Security posture (consolidated)

Worker credential = fine-grained PAT scoped to the product's repos, via GH_TOKEN env only. No MCP in
workers. Deny-floor hook always installed (removable, on the owner's head): the repo ships a
**generic floor** (force-push to default branch, `gh auth` mutation, probe path) and appends the
operator's concrete protected-path list from gitignored `local/deny.local` at runtime — instance
specifics never live in the public tree. Hooks <1s. Craig overlay (`local/INSTANCE.md`, untracked):
agent accounts, mini paths, protected list, notifier wiring; other resident automation stays fully
out of Remudero's process tree, plain `claude` CLI auth only. **Per-project secrets (WS-2/3
forward design)**: products under management will need runtime secrets (test API keys, service
tokens) — these live per-project in `local/secrets/<project>.env`, globally denyRead'd, injected by
the control plane ONLY into that project's workers, never cross-project. **Terms note (README)**:
operators run the harness on their own subscription per Anthropic's terms — one operator, one
account, one machine; the harness is a tool for your seat, not a seat-multiplier.

## 8A. Knowledge architecture & context economy

W1-T19 shipped the READ side of the compounding loop, which makes the knowledge ARCHITECTURE
load-bearing. The governing principle [research, Anthropic "Effective context engineering"]: **find the
smallest set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of the desired outcome** — context is a
precious, finite resource, not a place to dump everything we know. Knowledge is a MEMORY HIERARCHY, not a
file:

- **TIER 0 — ALWAYS-ON, STABLE PREFIX.** The Promptsmith preamble + invariant rules (distrust-the-prompt,
  autonomy clause, the deny-floor facts). **Line-capped (~150)** and it must change RARELY — every edit
  busts the prompt cache for every worker rendered after it (see the ordering rule).
- **TIER 1 — MATCHED INJECTION (deterministic, just-in-time).** Learnings matched by `subsystem:`/`files:`
  tags (`src/lib/learnings.ts`), under the knowledge budget. VOLATILE (the corpus grows every retro) ⇒ it
  goes **LAST** in the prompt, never early.
- **TIER 2 — RETRIEVED, NOT INJECTED.** The plan is ~900 lines and growing; it is **NOT shipped to
  workers**. Inject a **PLAN INDEX** (section headings + one-line summaries + where to grep). Workers have
  grep/glob — this is Claude Code's OWN hybrid model (CLAUDE.md up front + glob/grep for retrieval), which
  "bypasses the issues of stale indexing" [research]. W1-T37 builds it.
- **TIER 3 — RUN-LOCAL, NEVER PERSISTED.** Recon output, transcripts — externalized to the ledger/scratch,
  never promoted into Tier 0/1.

**ORDERING RULE (cache-aware): STABLE FIRST, VOLATILE LAST.** Caches key on EXACT PREFIX BYTES — any edit
early in the context invalidates the cache for everything after it, and cache reads price at ~1/10th of
fresh input [research]. So the stable prefix (Tier 0) leads and the volatile matched-learnings (Tier 1)
trail. This is now **MEASURABLE, not a matter of opinion**: the result envelope already carries
`cache_read_input_tokens` + `cache_creation_input_tokens` (WS-0) — ledger them, and **near-zero cache
reads on the second worker of a run means the ordering is wrong** (W1-T35).

★ THE MEMORY MODEL, NAMED (2026 taxonomy alignment). The Sec 8A tiers ARE the field-standard four memory types [research: coala, agent-memory-survey-2026], which clarifies where each lives and where the gaps are: EPISODIC = the NDJSON ledger + transcript archive (what happened, when, with what verdict); SEMANTIC = LEARNINGS (what is generally true); PROCEDURAL = prompt templates + the Sec 5B skill registry + campaigns (how to do X); WORKING = the run-local Tier-3 context (never persisted). The load-bearing loop the field calls CONSOLIDATION (episodic->semantic — 'without it agents recall but do not LEARN') is Remudero's RETRO, which already enforces the field's key discipline: the WRITE PATH goes THROUGH consolidation, never direct semantic writes from the worker loop (learnings are Architect-gated, rule 15). The gaps this taxonomy exposes are now proposals: measure whether semantic memory helps (P12, the Wipe Test), distill procedural memory from SUCCESS not only failure (P13), detect contradiction on consolidation (P14).

## 8B. Compaction doctrine

Compaction is a **SAFETY NET, never a strategy** — one-concern sessions should END before it matters
(§8A, §9). But it WILL fire (observed mean 19.8 turns, tasks at 36+), and today we do not even MEASURE
it, so a silently-degraded worker is indistinguishable from a good one. Compaction's sharp failure mode
[research]: **a summary that drops a critical fact is worse than no summary, because later steps trust it
and cannot recover what was lost** — a compacted message is removed from the window and recoverable ONLY
if it was STORED. Therefore, tuned for RECALL first, then precision:

- **DETECT + LEDGER every compaction event.** A run that compacted is flagged **QUALITY-SUSPECT** and its
  acceptance proofs are re-verified by the reviewer against REPO STATE (W1-T3F made that possible) — not
  trusted from a possibly-lossy REPORT (W1-T36).
- **ANCHORED SUMMARIZATION.** The task goal, acceptance criteria, and hard constraints are re-injected
  **VERBATIM** after any compaction — never handed to a summarizer, never paraphrased.
- **WRITE-BEFORE-COMPACT.** Workers externalize durable findings to a worktree scratch file **AS THEY
  GO**, not only in the final REPORT — a fact discovered at turn 5 must survive a compaction at turn 30.

## 9. Resource doctrine — mounts, windows & context

**Mounts — model selection is the remudero's core act.** `.remudero/mounts.yaml` is a
DETERMINISTIC policy table (no per-call LLM judgment): keyed by (task_type × risk × operator
thinking level) → {model, effort/thinking budget, max_turns, context_budget}. Operator params
(`subscription`, `thinking_default`, `metering: shared_pool|programmatic_credit|api_key` —
regime-proof; the June-15 walkback proved metering volatility — quiet-hours, permission profile,
notifier) are
**per-instance config, gathered by the first-run setup** — `rmd init` wizard v0, dashboard
Settings pane later — never plan constants. **Tier auto-discovery ladder (detect → confirm, never
silent)**: (1) parse headless `/status`–`/usage` output if machine-readable; (2) local account
metadata the CLI exposes, if any (spike-probed, not assumed); (3) **passive inference by the
HeadroomTracker** — observed limit magnitudes and the presence of dual weekly caps distinguish
tiers over time; (4) wizard asks, pre-filled with the best guess. Whatever is detected, the wizard
shows it for confirmation. Craig instance: `max20x`, `thinking_default: medium` (G-12/G-13).
Defaults encode the official guidance: **Sonnet default for execution; Opus on the bookends**
(Architect planning, DIAGNOSE workers, high-risk reviews); **Haiku for mechanical/high-volume**
(classification, doc-sync, campaign chores). Model-aware strike ladder: routine retries do NOT
auto-upgrade; **diagnose steps UP** — intelligence is spent where evidence-gathering pays.
Per-repo priors live in principles.yaml (a gnarly C# repo can default Sonnet-high-thinking; a docs
repo, Haiku).

**The Tier Invariant (G-17, Craig directive)**: the main agent ALWAYS rides a higher-thinking
mount than the coding agents — it reasons through the plan and orchestrates, so
`architect.tier > max(worker.tier)` and `architect.effort ≥ thinking_default` (floor: high for
plan authorship). This is a **config-validation rule, deterministically enforced**: a mounts.yaml
that violates it is rejected at load, and flywheel-proposed downgrades may lower workers freely but
can NEVER lower the Architect to or below the worker ceiling. The invariant is RELATIVE, not
absolute — an economy install may run Haiku workers under a Sonnet Architect and still comply; the
model-tier ordering table is config-maintained since the lineup shifts.

**Routing is knowledge — golden-calibrated.** mounts.yaml changes ship as PRs behind the golden
suite like every other knowledge change. The flywheel proposes DOWNGRADES when a cheaper mount
passes a task-type's goldens above threshold, and UPGRADES when strike-rate correlates with mount —
the harness learns which horse each job actually needs, with pre-merge proof it still clears the
jumps.

**Cost semantics (CORRECTED by WS-0)**: on subscription, `total_cost_usd` is NOTIONAL — it is the
API-equivalent price, not billed spend. It is therefore used for exactly two things: the
runaway-anomaly tripwire, and metering when `billing_mode == api`. **Subscription window tracking
parses `/usage`** (confirmed machine-readable headless).

**A per-task dollar cap is a BUG DETECTOR, not a budget.** `budget_usd` (and the per-spawn
`maxBudgetUsd` it feeds) exists to catch a worker in a LOOP, not to ration honest work. Setting it near
a task's expected cost converts a tripwire into a WORK LIMIT and destroys honest work — **observed twice:
`maxTurns` (18 vs. ~36 needed, PR #8) and `budget_usd` (W1-T3 killed `blocked_budget` at $3.57/36 turns
against a GUESSED $4 cap while still working)**. Same bug, one field over. So: caps sit an ORDER OF
MAGNITUDE above any observed cost (default $100), a SOFT threshold (default $25, config-tunable) only
LEDGERS A WARNING and continues — anomalies VISIBLE without being FATAL — and `blocked_budget` now means
"this worker is almost certainly looping," which is what a tripwire should mean. Window pressure (the
real limit) is the HeadroomTracker's job (W1-T4), never a per-task dollar cap. Do not lower these caps to
"save money": on subscription the dollars are notional, so you would kill good work and save nothing.
`max_turns` is now re-based to the SAME tripwire semantics as `budget_usd` — a flat 400 in EVERY ROW of
`.remudero/mounts.yaml`, an order of magnitude above the calibration mean (~45–55 turns; honest merges at
58–69) after run `W1-T54b-1784149952116` walled at 81/80 mid-live-campaign — and this is P7-consistent:
nothing is raised to mask over-scoping, because task SIZING is enforced pre-dispatch by the W1-T20c linter
(the sizer is the linter), not by a low turn cap. **★ HONEST LIMIT (R4/P10) — "flat 400" governs
MOUNT-DISPATCHED phases only, and that is NOT every worker.** `run-task.ts:946/:1018` read `mount.maxTurns`;
`run-task.ts:385` (12), `run-task.ts:1488` (40) and `containment.ts:122` (6) are HARDCODED and mounts.yaml
cannot reach them — and the table has rows for `recon`/`implement` ONLY, so `reviewer`/`fix`/`diagnose`
have nothing to key off. Three of R4's ten runs walled `error_max_turns` on such a phase AFTER the re-base
landed. A bounded literal can be correct (recon's `maxTurns: 8` is deliberate); an UNDECLARED one is not.
Until P10 lands, do not read this paragraph as "no worker walls under 400."

**Windows — the HeadroomTracker (rung 1 CONFIRMED).** Models both clocks: the 5-hour rolling window and the weekly
caps (including Max's dual weekly limits — all-models and Sonnet-only — with separate resets).
PRIMARY: parse `claude -p "/usage"` — session % + dual weekly windows + reset timestamps, all
machine-readable (WS-0 proven). Parse the weekly label as data (it names a MODEL; the lineup shifts).
Secondary: passive limit-hit parsing; `~/.claude.json` keys for tier inference (rung 2).
`/status` is unavailable headless — do not build on it. Scheduler behaviors it drives: **quiet-hours is now an OPTIONAL wizard toggle, default OFF**
(Craig, Q1/G-14: he expects to work mostly THROUGH the fleet, so interactive contention is managed
live via the control panel's Pause, not a schedule); **throttle → cheap-groom** (approaching a cap,
the fleet does NOT idle — it drains Haiku-class chores: doc-sync, triage, campaign recon);
**burst-at-reset** (queue depth + imminent window reset ⇒ heavy work scheduled to the reset);
weekly-aware pacing (Opus-hungry campaigns early in a weekly window get budgeted so Friday isn't
starved). Runaway tripwire, per-task attempt caps, and the OSS daily-cap default all stand.

**Env sanitization — the billing boundary (FIELD FINDING 1).** Worker environments are
**constructed, never inherited**: the control plane builds each child env from an explicit
allowlist (PATH, HOME, TMPDIR, GH_TOKEN, project vars) and **strips all ANTHROPIC_\* variables** so
Claude Code falls back to the operator's subscription OAuth. The API key is injected ONLY when the
overflow valve is deliberately engaged. `billing_mode` is therefore a decision the harness makes
and records, never an accident it inherits — and the daemon asserts at startup that its own env is
clean (a `launchctl setenv` key would otherwise leak in). **Conditional cap guard**: `no dollar
cap` (G-3) is VALID ONLY while `billing_mode == subscription`; any run in `api` mode is hard-capped
by the daily cap regardless of operator settings. Config validation rejects
`overflow: api_key` + `daily_cap: none`.

**Overflow valve** (operator opt-in): `overflow: none|api_key` — when subscription windows are
exhausted and priority ≥ threshold tasks are queued, those runs route via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY at
metered rates while cheap work waits for reset. Every ledger line carries `billing_mode`.

**Context doctrine — architecture first, compaction as safety net.** The harness's primary context
strategy is structural: fresh, scoped, one-concern sessions with all durable state external in
git + ledger — sessions should END before compaction matters; auto-compaction (with CLAUDE.md
re-read) is the net, not the plan. Promptsmith style rules, enforced in templates: reference bare
paths, never @-injection (which pulls the whole file + its CLAUDE.md tree); batch related
instructions into one turn; recon-before-implement stands in for plan-mode. **Context telemetry**:
per-turn token usage from stream-json lands in the ledger → a **context-budget ratchet** per task
template (breach files an improvement task; the 200K 2×-billing cliff is a hard ceiling). Exact
resource knobs on the installed version — effort levels, thinking toggles/budgets, max_turns,
auto-compact settings — are spike step-5 probe targets (v4.1), recorded as ground truth in
FINDINGS, never assumed from docs-of-the-week. NDJSON ledger meters everything regardless of
billing mode: spawn/end, model, effort, tokens, total_cost_usd, billing_mode, verdicts, decisions —
**including brain-plane calls** (Architect/Promptsmith invocations log purpose, model, tokens,
cost as first-class ledger citizens; the orchestrator's own spend is never invisible).
Craig instance (G-3): no daily dollar cap — pace to Max limits via the tracker.

## Self-improvement: flywheel, retros, knowledge & the commons

The mechanism behind L3, the answer to "verdicting is where this succeeds or dies," and — per
Craig's directive — the thing that makes every project on this harness self-improving, with a path
to a shared brain across all of them:

- **Flywheel analyzer** (nightly, Haiku/Sonnet): reads the run ledger + task transcripts, mines for
  patterns — repeated transient causes, prompts that needed fix rounds, gates that never fire,
  reviewer misses (merged PRs later reverted/re-fixed) — and files evidence-cited improvement tasks
  into Remudero's own tasks.yaml. Same shape as the ClawApp SRE flywheel (analyze-diagnostics →
  suggestions inbox), pointed at the harness itself. Suppression rules from day one (stale-error
  maps, fingerprint reuse guards — the analyze-diagnostics lessons apply verbatim).
- **LEARNINGS.md per target repo**: diagnose workers and reviewers append durable lessons in place
  ("App Insights pinned 2.22.0 — 3.1.2 crashed startup"-class facts). The Promptsmith injects
  matching entries into prompts as first-class provenance sources (`[src: learnings#…]`). This is
  "the repo remembers its outages in place," made machine-readable.
- **Transcript archive + predecessor query**: every worker session transcript is archived per task;
  fix/diagnose workers may read their predecessors' transcripts before acting (Gas Town's "seance"
  pattern, done as plain files — no daemon mysticism required).
- **Golden-task eval suite**: a set of canned tasks on the sandbox repo with known-good outcomes
  (including planted violations: TDD skip, scope creep, test theater, provenance-free prompt).
  CI runs the proto-runner/daemon against them on every Remudero PR; measures loop completion,
  verdict accuracy (planted violations caught?), cost per task. Regressions in the harness's
  judgment become red CI, not vibes. This is mutation-testing discipline applied to the orchestrator.
- **Verdict calibration**: reviewer verdicts log confidence + rubric scores; a periodic job compares
  them against post-merge reality (revert rate, follow-up-fix rate within N days) and files tuning
  tasks when calibration drifts.

**Retro ceremony (scheduled, not just reactive)**: at every workstream close + a weekly patrol,
the Architect runs a structured retro over the ledger, transcripts, DECISIONS, questions/answers,
and verdict-calibration data. Outputs are always artifacts, never vibes: LEARNINGS.md updates,
**CLAUDE.md / agents-file / prompt-template diffs as PRs**, principles-profile tuning proposals,
new golden tasks minted from real failures, and campaign proposals (§3A) when a finding spans
repos. Retros must also DELETE — compression is a deliverable, not just accretion.

**RATIFY-OR-KILL (standing duty, from P8):** every retro RE-GRADES every open proposal to exactly one of
**ratified** (minted as a tasks.yaml task — cite the id) | **re-ranked** (still open, priority restated
against new data) | **retired** (superseded/deleted, with the reason). The status is written INTO the
proposals section, so the list can never become a graveyard. **An unranked proposal that survives TWO
retros is itself a plan-health flag** (a W1-T20d input) — an unratified proposal is not neutral backlog,
it decays, and the failure it predicted recurs (P3→P8: `blocked_review` fired again a full retro after
P3 proposed a guard for it).

**HARNESS-COMPRESSION (a required retro item):** *"Which guards are now unnecessary? Which prompts are
over-prescriptive?"* Harnesses encode assumptions about what Claude cannot do on its own, and **those
assumptions go stale as models improve** [research] — a guard that was load-bearing at one model version
can become dead weight (or an active constraint) at the next. So a retro that only ADDS guards is failing
the same bar as a retro that only ADDS docs: it must also question and retire the harness's own scaffolding,
not just the plan's prose. Retire behind the golden suite (a removed guard that regresses a planted-violation
catch goes red before it merges), same RSI-safety rule as any other self-modification.

**Knowledge system (the RSI-safety rule)**: knowledge and prompt changes ARE CODE. Every CLAUDE.md,
agents-file, prompt-template, and principles edit ships as a PR, git-versioned (rollback = revert),
and **gated behind the golden-task suite** — a prompt change that regresses a planted-violation
catch or loop completion goes red before it can poison the fleet. This is the piece most
self-improving setups skip: without versioning + pre-merge signal, a bad self-modification has no
recovery path and no alarm. Budgets enforce "short and alive": CLAUDE.md line cap (default ~150,
gated), LEARNINGS entries carry provenance + last-cited date and get compressed/pruned on retro
(the analyze-diagnostics pruning discipline, applied to knowledge). Injection stays
provenance-clean: `[src: learnings#… | claude-md#… | commons#…]`.

**The Commons (universal brain — WS-11)**: a layered knowledge hierarchy the Promptsmith reads
nearest-first: **project** (LEARNINGS.md, CLAUDE.md) → **org brain** (operator's private
cross-project store) → **commons** (public remudero-commons repo shipped with the harness).
A DISTILL pass classifies retro learnings: project-private stays put; **universal candidates**
(tech facts, platform gotchas, pattern fixes — "App Insights 3.1.2 crashes isolated workers"-class)
are proposed upward as **skill-shaped packages** via human-gated PRs — never telemetry, never
auto-upload; the operator reviews every outbound distillation. Contribution to the public commons
is the community mechanism; **hosted org-brain sync** joins the Pro candidate list (§6/D-8).

Prior-art note: this is "compounding engineering" made governable — the ecosystem pattern (codify
decisions into CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md so each unit of work makes the next easier; skills as
cross-project procedural memory) plus the two pieces the ecosystem's own literature says are
usually missing: versioned rollback and pre-merge evaluation of self-modifications. External-ledger
task tracking for long-running agents remains the documented direction (Anthropic Nov-2025;
Beads 23k★). Remudero's bet is unchanged and now closed-loop: **small worker counts, hard verdicts,
plan-first — and a harness that provably gets better at its own job.**

## 10. Workstreams

**WS-0 — Spike — ✅ SHIPPED & MERGED** (PR #1; see SHIPPED log). Ground truth in FIELD FINDING 10;
`src/lib/` kept spike-free ⇒ WS-1 lifted it directly.

**WS-1 — Proto-runner → daemon — ✅ SHIPPED & COMPLETE 2026-07-15.** G-2 held: WS-1 built itself THROUGH
the proto-runner, daemonization last. Acceptance MET far past the "≥6 tasks merged via `rmd run-task`"
bar. **Full inventory, the two honest deltas (bounded drill, no digest capture), and the residue that
belongs to WS-7 are stated ONCE in NET STATE — not restated here** (they were duplicated near-verbatim in
both places for two retros). **Remainder scoped here and NOT shipped: flight control (W1-T20–T22), §5C's
linter (W1-T20c/d), the knowledge holes (W1-T33–T39)** — mounts.yaml v0 (W1-T5) SHIPPED as #42.

**WS-2 — Flow & quality**: reviewer worker + rubric; provenance linter hardened; N-concurrent
worktrees with per-repo caps + **merge serialization per repo** (Bors-style: never two auto-merges
racing one main); **task heartbeats + stall detection** (no ledger output in N min ⇒ classify hung,
kill, transient-retry); stuck-PR shepherd (absorbs/retires pr-pipeline.sh); rate-limit-aware
dispatch governor; scope guard (diff/files budget); first fleet-repo target (wild-trails backlog).
Acceptance: two tasks run concurrently, one induced conflict auto-resolves, one induced hang is
detected and recycled; proof = ledger timeline.

**WS-3 — Principles engine**: principles.yaml loader; TDD Guard integration + red→green REPORT
proof; coverage ratchet + jscpd + dependency-cruiser CI templates; auto-filed refactor tasks;
reviewer rubric wired to profile. Acceptance: a `tdd: strict` task is BLOCKED when implementation
precedes a failing test (planted violation), passes when honest; proof = hook denial + green run.

**WS-4 — OSS packaging**: rename executed (D-1); Apache-2.0; `npx remudero init`; adapters; permission
profiles with `standard` default; README + security disclosure + quickstart (<5 min to first looped
PR on a toy repo); CI templates published. **Setup Agent (Q3/G-16)**: the wizard's WS-4 evolution —
an agentic onboarding session that interviews the new operator, **walks through public-vs-private
repo pros and cons** (G-1 was Craig's answer, never the shipped default — the Setup Agent counsels
and the operator chooses), then EXECUTES as much setup as possible via sub-agents: repo creation
through gh (**org-aware; explicitly sets allow_auto_merge, delete_branch_on_merge, and secret
scanning + push protection — fresh-repo defaults break agent pipelines, FIELD FINDING 8**),
plan-repo scaffold, CI templates, hooks/settings install, root layout, first golden run; PAT minting stays MANUAL with guided deep-links (credentials are never agent-handled).
**The project website is now its OWN workstream, WS-12** (repo `remudero-site` — separate cadence and
audience, D-5): it must not couple to the daemon's CI. Its quickstart is still the WS-4 acceptance bar
(clean machine → first auto-merged PR).

**WS-5 — UI**: v0 live board (SSE); v1 in-UI editing + agent proposals as PRs. Port audited (18793
taken on Craig's mini). Acceptance v0: watching a live run shows state flips within 2s of ledger
writes; proof = timestamp diff.

**WS-6 — Collaboration**: remudero-mcp server + scoped tokens; claude.ai custom-connector runbook;
CRDT co-editing spike (D-3 gate). Acceptance: an external Claude session reads the plan and files a
proposal PR through the connector; proof = PR authored via MCP path.

**WS-7 — Hardening**: chaos drills (kill worker mid-run, daemon restart mid-loop, network flap,
**reboot-resilience: does the LaunchAgent load and OAuth still authenticate after a cold boot with
no console login? — FIELD FINDING 4 residual**);
explicit supervision chain (launchd restarts daemon → daemon supervises workers via heartbeats →
freshness sentinel watches the daemon — who-watches-whom is documented, no unwatched layer);
worktree/disk GC watchdog; restart-recovery test is a required CI job; **nightly $ROOT/state
backup** (ledger + calibration data are irreplaceable history; git+GitHub already cover the rest)
with a **documented + drilled restore** (fresh machine → clone + rmd init + restore = fleet back);
**Claude Code CLI version is pinned config, not ambient** — a release watcher files platform-bump
tasks, and version bumps ship behind the golden suite like any other change (the platform itself is
a gated dependency; every knob we probed varies by version). Acceptance: daemon killed mid-task
recovers to correct state from git+GitHub alone; restore drill executed once from backup.

**WS-8 — Flywheel, retros & evals**: golden-task suite in CI from the proto-runner era onward.
**★ GOLDENS SPLIT BY EXECUTION SURFACE (rule-20 sweep):** CI-RUN goldens are FIXTURE-only (no LLM, no
subscription OAuth — GitHub Actions has none, and a self-hosted runner on a PUBLIC repo is a security
anti-pattern); anything needing a REAL worker/daemon run is a DAEMON-RUN LIVE golden, executed by the
self-hosting daemon on a SCHEDULE (its own Max-subscription host) which posts a commit STATUS via `gh`
back to the PR/commit. The CI job never spawns a worker; the daemon is the only thing that holds the
billing boundary. This split governs every golden below.
(The suite grows with each workstream, and with every real failure minted into a golden); nightly flywheel
analyzer + suppression rules; **retro ceremony** (workstream-close + weekly patrol) producing
LEARNINGS updates AND agents-file/prompt-template PRs; **knowledge budgets gate** (CLAUDE.md line
cap ~150 default, LEARNINGS provenance + last-cited pruning); **prompt/knowledge-changes-behind-
goldens** enforced in CI; LEARNINGS.md pipeline + Promptsmith injection; transcript archive +
predecessor query; verdict-calibration job **+ mount-routing calibration** (golden-backed
downgrade/upgrade proposals for mounts.yaml, filed as retro PRs); DISTILL classifier stub. Acceptance: planted TDD-skip
golden caught in CI; seeded ledger pattern → exactly one evidence-cited improvement task (no dupes
on rerun); ★ a deliberately-degraded prompt-template PR goes RED on the golden suite before merge;
one retro produces a net-negative diff somewhere (compression proven); proofs = CI runs + diffs.

**WS-9 — Mobile**: RESHAPED — mobile is now **shell 2 of the one-web-app control panel** (§7), delivered
as the Tauri iOS spike **W3-T4** over the generated api-client (§7A), NOT a separate client. Baseline
regardless of shell: responsive dashboard verified on phone over tailnet (M0, shell 0); **push is an
adapter concern, not an app concern** (GitHub-mobile today; no shell needs remote push to ship);
remote STOP + escalation-answer + quiet-hours toggle land as W3-T5. Expo is the documented iOS fallback
with a named trigger (§7). Acceptance: from a phone off the home network (tailnet up), answer one
escalation and STOP one running loop; proof = ledger entries originating from the client's bearer token.

**WS-10 — Campaigns**: campaign spec loader + Architect instantiation; v1 catalog (§3A); baseline
capture from ledger/CI; standing/scheduled/retro-filed triggers wired to idle-groom + quiet-hours.
Acceptance: a coverage-raise campaign across remudero + remudero-sandbox lands per-repo PRs whose
merged deltas meet the formula; proof = baseline-vs-after ledger lines + merged PRs.

**WS-11 — The Commons (universal brain)**: knowledge-hierarchy loader (project → org → commons,
nearest wins, provenance-tagged injection); DISTILL flow with human-gated outbound PRs to the
public remudero-commons repo; skills-shaped packaging. Acceptance: a universal learning distilled
from remudero's own retros lands in commons via a reviewed PR and is cited by a worker prompt in a
second project; proof = provenance chain across two ledgers.

**WS-12 — Website** (repo `remudero-site`, SEPARATE from core — D-5): **Astro Starlight on Vercel**
(fleet pattern). It **PUBLISHES the repo's CANONICAL docs, never a second copy** (§12A "one source, three
surfaces"): the **GENERATED CLI reference** (Tier A, from the command registry — W1-T48) · the
**GENERATED API reference** (from the §7A OpenAPI surface) · the **rendered Tier-B guides** (concept,
architecture, operator, troubleshooting, security/limitations) · **LEARNINGS.md as a public artifact**
(nobody else ships the receipts — the differentiator) · landing (the anti-slop thesis) · **<5-min
quickstart** · CONTRIBUTING / GOVERNANCE / TRADEMARK. **Nothing on the site is authored twice** — a
hand-edit to a generated page is rejected by the drift gate (W1-T49). Repo creation is MANUAL (credentials
never agent-handled); post-L2 the site's content maintenance becomes a **harness-run task** (the site is
dogfood too — W12-T1). Acceptance: the site builds and deploys, and its quickstart takes a clean machine to
a first auto-merged PR; proof = deploy URL + the quickstart transcript.

**Client workstream (W3 — the API contract + the three shells)**: `packages/api-client` is generated from
the daemon surface (§7A) and **BLOCKS every client** (W3-T1); the dashboard (shell 0, W3-T2), Tauri macOS
(shell 1, W3-T3), Tauri iOS spike (shell 2, W3-T4), and human-in-the-loop panel actions (W3-T5) all
consume ONLY the api-client. Nothing client-side starts before the contract lands.

Dependencies: WS-0 → WS-1 → {WS-2, WS-3} → WS-4 → WS-5 → WS-6; WS-7 threads from WS-1 onward;
WS-8 seeds at WS-0 (goldens), retro ceremony activates at WS-1, completes after WS-2; **W3 (clients)
gate on W3-T1 (the api-client contract) → W3-T2 → {W3-T3 → W3-T4, W3-T5}**; WS-9 M1 lands free with
WS-1, M0 with WS-5a/W3-T2, mobile shell = W3-T4; WS-10 after {WS-2, WS-8 baselines}; WS-11 after WS-4 +
a second project on the harness; **WS-12 (site) is independent — separate repo, separate cadence**.

## 11. Open decisions

- **D-1 Name — CLOSED 2026-07-14: Remudero (domains purchased)**. The remudero is the wrangler in
  charge of the remuda — the orchestrator's own job title, and a recovery of the remuda concept one
  level up. Alias `rmd`; binary `remudero` with `rmd` symlink. Full saga: drover (registries +
  cloud-shuttle same-space) → foreman (npm + Red Hat) → millwright/gaffer (npm + GafferHQ) →
  overlander (domains) → remuda (domains) → millrace (FATAL: 65★ governed-agentic-loops runtime) →
  nightmuster (registrar-verified .com, superseded on pick) → **Remudero**. Method that closed it:
  container DNS screening across .dev/.io/.com/.sh, retro-validated against both registrar failures,
  with .com-NXDOMAIN demoted to weak signal and finalists restricted to zero-footprint compounds
  (0 GitHub repos, no packages on any registry, no web presence). Evidence trail: git history of
  this line. G-10 bar for the record: .dev+.io(+.sh) suffices, .com nice-to-have — moot; purchased.
- **D-2 License — RESOLVED**: Apache-2.0 (patent grant; ships in PR #1). Veto window: before the
  spike PR merges.
- **D-3 Plan co-editing tech**: CRDT (Yjs) vs PR-proposals-only. Defer until v1 UI is lived-in (rec).
- **D-4 OSS default permission profile**: `standard` (rec). Craig's instance: `yolo`.
- **D-5 Repo shape — RESOLVED 2026-07-14: MONOREPO for everything that consumes the daemon API;
  separate repos for everything that does not.** **Repo shape follows CONTRACT COUPLING — nothing else
  decides it.** The monorepo `remudero` (npm workspaces) holds: the **daemon** · **CLI** · **MCP** ·
  **`packages/api-client`** (the generated contract, §7A) · **`apps/dashboard`** (web) ·
  **`apps/desktop`** (Tauri macOS shell) · **`apps/mobile`** (Tauri iOS shell). THE ARGUMENT: every one
  of these consumes the SAME daemon API contract; in a monorepo a breaking API change **fails CI across
  ALL consumers atomically, in one PR**, so drift cannot ship. Split repos make that drift SILENT —
  discoverable only at runtime, which is exactly the failure three clients-of-a-daemon must never have.
  **SEPARATE repos, deliberately** (different cadence/audience, no contract coupling): **`remudero-site`**
  (docs/marketing, WS-12 — a docs typo must not run mutation testing, and a daemon change must not
  redeploy the site) · **`remudero-commons`** (WS-11) · **`remudero-pro`** (§6A — never mixed with core,
  ever). See §7A (the contract) and §7 (one web app, three shells).
- **D-9 CLA vs DCO — RESOLVED: DCO**, one-way door closed knowingly (§6A). Reversal requires a CLA
  from day one; retrofitting is impossible. Revisit ONLY if the project's purpose changes materially.
- **D-8 Monetization**: open-core per §6 stance (rec); shape/pricing decided post-WS-6 traction,
  never earlier — premature paywalling kills the community the differentiation depends on.

## 12. Standing rules

1. PROVENANCE OR IT DOESN'T GO IN A PROMPT.
2. Trust, scheduling, strikes, budgets = deterministic predicates. Never LLM decisions.
3. One concern per PR. Branch from latest origin/main. Isolated worktrees.
3B. **The merge gate is a GitHub-enforced CONTRACT (required status checks), never a runner-side
   decision that can be raced.** `ci` (typecheck+tests) AND `remudero-review` (acceptance verdict by a
   fresh-context reviewer) must both be green; GitHub does the merging. The runner ARMS auto-merge and
   observes — its exit verdict is advisory telemetry, incapable of diverging from reality. Corollary:
   auto-merge is safe to leave armed, because the contract, not the runner, decides.
4. Acceptance criteria are proofs, not vibes. Green checks ≠ evidence (the full-shop-flow lesson).
5. Never a third blind patch: two strikes → diagnose → one evidence-armed retry → escalate.
6. Zero ask rules in worker settings. Hooks <1s. Workers carry scoped PATs only. No MCP in workers.
7. **DISTRUST THE PROMPT OVER THE INSTALLED VERSION.** Empirically the highest-value line in the
   template: WS-0 caught `allowedDomains` nesting; W1-T1 caught that the SDK's own schema is `$loose`
   and silently strips unknown keys — a guard built as specified would have PASSED the typo it exists
   to catch. Every Promptsmith-rendered prompt injects this rule. Read the installed schema; never
   trust a prompt's spelling, including this document's.
8. OpenClaw stays out. The mini's protected paths are inviolate (deny-floor).
8. The loop never waits on a human unless the plan says so. Idle = groom.
9. OSS defaults must be defensible on a stranger's machine; yolo is a documented opt-in.
10. This document is truth. Every session syncs it before acting and after shipping.
11. **Isolation and containment are PROVEN PER RUN by probe, never assumed from configuration.** A
   setting that "should" isolate (ZDOTDIR, a sandbox block, a stripped env) is a hypothesis until a
   preflight probe confirms it on THIS machine, THIS run — config that happens to work by accident of
   the host (PR #8: isolation held only because `~/.bashrc` was absent) must fail closed the moment the
   accident ends. See FIELD FINDING 11, W1-T17.
12. **Supervision is deterministic; judgment is advisory. An LLM may RECOMMEND a halt; only code may
   ENFORCE one.** The flight judge and specialist panels (§4B) return verdicts a deterministic
   controller acts on; no LLM sits in the merge decision, and none edits code. See §4B, W1-T20/21/22,
   W2-T1.
13. **A doc that DESCRIBES a mechanism is never proof the mechanism EXISTS.** Acceptance proofs must be
   OBSERVABLE SYSTEM STATE — `gh api` output, a status object, a grep of the call site, a passing test —
   never a file that talks about it. PR #12 shipped `docs/review-gate.md`, passed CI, reported
   `verdict=merged`, and did none of its job (protection unchanged, no status ever posted). [PR #12/#13]
14. **Splitting a task can ORPHAN its call site — when you split, name the integration point explicitly
   as one side's deliverable.** T1C built the reviewer and T1D was to enforce it, but NEITHER owned
   `run-task.ts` CALLING it; the reviewer was fully-tested dead code for two PRs. The wiring is a
   deliverable, not a seam. [PR #12/#13]
15. **When a worker is blocked by an acceptance gate, it may ADD the missing work or ESCALATE. It may
   NEVER edit the acceptance criteria to match its diff.** Workers have write access to `plan/tasks.yaml`,
   so this prohibition is stated in every rendered prompt, not assumed. The gate names the gap; the fix
   is to close the gap, not to move the goalposts. [session doctrine]
16. **The Architect may correct a mis-specified task via a plan PR; a worker may never. The test of
   honesty is that NO criterion is dropped or weakened — only REDISTRIBUTED.** A task whose criteria span
   multiple subsystems collides with one-concern-per-PR and is undeliverable; the Architect decomposes it
   by CONCERN (every criterion survives verbatim in some child task), and the `satisfied_by` field
   (Architect-only, plan-only PRs — rule 15) marks a criterion an earlier merge already satisfied. Splits
   observed: T1C, T1D, W1-T3. [PR #22, W1-T3] 
17. **PROVENANCE FOR THE PLAN, NOT JUST FOR PROMPTS.** Every task must cite WHY it exists (`origin:`
   feedback#/retro#/architect/human + `plan_refs:` the sections it implements). A task with no origin is
   an ORPHAN and cannot be trusted to reflect anyone's intent. `origin:`/`plan_refs:` are Architect-only,
   plan-only fields (same rule as `satisfied_by`, rule 15): a worker adding an origin to justify its own
   diff is editing the plan to match the work. `rmd trace` (W1-T43) makes the chain feedback → task → run
   → PR renderable both ways. [§7B]
18. **EVERY ACCEPTANCE CRITERION MUST BE SATISFIABLE BY A NON-INTERACTIVE WORKER.** A criterion that
   requires live operator input ("operator confirms", "user selects", "prompt the human") is STRUCTURALLY
   UNFIT for the headless runner — there is no TTY and no operator, so the worker cannot satisfy or test
   it and will burn its whole budget trying (W1-T9 spent its last ~15 turns on readline-repro scripts
   conjuring an operator that isn't there, then died error_max_turns). Interactive behavior is designed
   for no-TTY and tested via INJECTED INPUT / FLAGS / TTY-ABSENT DEFAULTS, never a live human in the loop:
   a prompt is an interactive-only affordance layered on top of a fully non-interactive path. This is a
   new error CLASS, distinct from over-scoping (rule 19) and looping. [DIAGNOSIS.md diag/w1t9-max-turns, W1-T9]
19. **SIZING IS A PLAN-LAYER CONCERN, NOT A BUDGET KNOB.** A task spanning ≥2 independent acceptance
   concerns, or shipping ≥2 new subsystems, must be `risk: high` or DECOMPOSED at plan time — never left
   `risk: medium` and rescued with a bigger turn budget. Two cross-cutting tasks (W1-T6, W1-T9) overran
   the medium/80 mount; the medium budget is correctly calibrated for genuine single-concern work
   (observed mean now 45.2 turns — RETRO-1784133446353, 22 runs; honest single-concern merges ran 58–69
   turns: #47, #48, #55, #56, #62 — still under the medium/80 ceiling; P7 ratified), so raising it would
   MASK over-scoping and reward it (and W1-T9 was the THIRD max_turns event — a third budget bump was
   refused). The retro fix lives in task SIZING (rule 16 decomposition), not in `.remudero/mounts.yaml`.
   [DIAGNOSIS.md diag/w1t9-max-turns, W1-T6, W1-T9; P7 RETRO-1784133446353]
20. **A NEW SIZING/FITNESS RULE MUST RETROACTIVELY RE-GRADE THE OPEN QUEUE — RULES ARE NOT FORWARD-ONLY.**
   When a rule like 18 or 19 is added, every ALREADY-AUTHORED open task must be re-checked against it, not
   only new authoring. W1-T12 pre-existed rules 18 and 19 and violated BOTH (three concerns at `risk:medium`;
   three live-context criteria — overnight drain, launchctl-load, live-kill) yet still reached a worker and
   burned 81 turns / $10.27 — the FOURTH max_turns event — because the rules were enforced forward-only.
   `rmd retro` re-grades every open task against every standing rule and files a corrective task for each
   violation (the executable duty is W1-T20d). A rule the queue is never swept against protects only the
   tasks written after it. [DIAGNOSIS.md diag/w1t12-max-turns, W1-T12]

- Lives at repo root. Header carries sync date + focus, his-house style.
- Humans and agents edit via commits/PRs; the Architect does narrative syncs at workstream
  boundaries; the control plane flips task statuses only.
- Sections are append-biased: shipped arcs move to a SHIPPED log (added at first ship); lessons land
  in Standing rules or the relevant section in place — the repo remembers its outages where they happened.
- External Claude (design partner) contributions arrive as chat-produced patches until WS-6, then
  through remudero-mcp.

## 12A. Documentation as a gated artifact, in tiers

Docs are scattered (W1-T30 skeleton, W1-T39 ORIENTATION, WS-12 website) with no coherence and no anti-rot
GUARANTEE. As the CLI grows (`feedback`, `triage`, `trace`, `drain`, `skill`, `plan --mode`, `retro`),
`rmd --help` and the docs DRIFT from reality unless drift is a CI FAILURE. Docs-as-code fails because "it
assumes humans notice when docs fall behind" [research]; the fix is an AWARENESS LAYER that ties a change
to the docs it falsified. Split by AUTOMATABILITY:

**TIER A — GENERATED; drift = CI-RED** (the automatable layer — structured-in → structured-out):
- **`rmd --help` and every subcommand's help are GENERATED from a single command registry** (one source of
  truth), never hand-maintained (W1-T47). A CI check asserts every command has help + examples; a command
  with **no registry entry FAILS CI**.
- **The CLI reference doc is GENERATED from that same registry** (W1-T48) — so `rmd --help`, the GitHub
  `/docs`, and the website CLI page CANNOT disagree; they share a source.
- **The API reference (§7A `packages/api-client`) is GENERATED from the OpenAPI surface.**
- **CHANGELOG is generated from Conventional Commits** (W1-T31).

**TIER B — HUMAN/ARCHITECT-AUTHORED; gated by the reviewer** (the non-automatable layer — needs context
absent from the codebase):
- Concept guides, architecture (§ links), the operator guide, troubleshooting, the security/limitations
  page. Maintained by `rmd retro` + the docs rubric; the §5-layer-2 reviewer rubric already flags a
  behavior-changing diff with no doc update (W1-T30) — EXTEND it to require the RIGHT tier (a command
  change ⇒ Tier A regen; a concept change ⇒ a Tier-B edit or an explicit waiver).

**THE AWARENESS LAYER (the anti-rot mechanism):** a diff touching a COMMAND or the API surface must
**regenerate Tier A — CI enforces BYTE-EQUALITY** (regenerate in CI and diff; stale generated docs = RED,
naming the drifted command, W1-T48) — and must update or explicitly WAIVE Tier B. This is W1-T29
plan-claims applied to docs: **docs are not evidence unless CI proves they match the code.**

**ONE SOURCE, THREE SURFACES:** registry → (`rmd --help` | GitHub `/docs` | website CLI page). Never three
hand-copies (W1-T49). The website (WS-12) RENDERS the repo's canonical docs; nothing there is authored
twice. `docs/ORIENTATION.md` (W1-T39, retro-maintained) and the `docs/` skeleton (W1-T30) are the Tier-B
spine this coheres — one doc set, not scattered tasks.

## 13. Plan-sync: the in-repo PR flow (never scp again)

`MASTER-PLAN.md` and `plan/tasks.yaml` were once copied into the tree
out-of-band (scp), arriving DIRTY with no provenance. Fixed: plan edits land
**exactly like code** — branch, edit, open a PR, gate on the same `ci` +
`remudero-review` checks as any other change. No file ever arrives by
scp/rsync/manual copy again. Full flow, including the `Acceptance:` block a
plan-only PR needs to unblock `remudero-review`: [docs/plan-sync.md](docs/plan-sync.md)
(W1-T15).

## 14. Immediate queue

**SETUP COMPLETE (2026-07-14)** — the full inventory (repos, org settings, workspace, auth, deny-floor)
is SUPERSEDED by NET STATE and deleted here rather than maintained twice. Still-live residue only:
scoped sandbox PAT deferred → WS-1 hardening (FIELD FINDING 9).

**NEXT: see NET STATE + SHIPPED log** (WS-0 and WS-1 both SHIPPED; the daemon runs itself; L2 active —
WS-2+ drains THROUGH the daemon, starting with the §5C linter W1-T20c/d).

**Craig's standing side-items (outside Remudero):** (1) the `~/.zshrc` API-key billing leak — **see
FIELD FINDING 2**, which states it in full; the restatement that lived here is deleted (one fact, one
home). (2) One-time employer IP/moonlighting policy glance given the director role; the public tree is
already scrubbed to that standard.

**Grill RESOLVED (complete record):**
- **G-1** → public from day 1 (hygiene woven into §6/§8; spike acceptance includes leak-grep).
- **G-2** → proto-runner; **L1 COMPLETE — L2 now active** (WS-1 shipped; daemonization landed last, as
  planned).
- **G-3** → pace to Max limits, no dollar cap (§9: limit-aware backpressure, quiet-hours throttle,
  per-worker runaway tripwire retained as anomaly detection).
- **G-4/G-7/G-8/G-9/G-10/G-11 (naming + domains) → ALL MOOT, FOLDED.** Remudero chosen, domains
  purchased 2026-07-14; the bar (≥2 TLDs), the no-auto-advance protocol, and the full registrar saga
  are recorded ONCE in **D-1**. Six near-duplicate grill lines restating a closed decision deleted here.
- **G-5** → tailnet dashboard first; Expo standalone later (§7 mobile ladder).
- **G-6** → Issues + Discussions OFF until WS-4; pre-alpha banner; CODEOWNERS from PR #1 (§6).
- **G-12** → Craig instance = Max 20x; **directive**: tier is per-instance setup config, never a
  plan constant, with auto-discovery on attach (§9 detect→confirm ladder; wizard + Settings pane).
- **G-13** → thinking_default: medium.
- **G-14 (pre-build)** → same Max 20x pool; Craig expects to work mostly THROUGH the fleet ⇒
  quiet-hours optional/off; **Pause (drain-and-hold) added to the control set** — his directive.
- **G-15 (pre-build)** → BlueBubbles acceptable but nothing may be Craig-specific in the default
  path ⇒ **imessage-local reference adapter** (native osascript on the host Mac) built at WS-1.
- **G-16 (pre-build)** → first project = remudero itself (confirmed); new-instance onboarding =
  **Setup Agent** with public/private counsel + sub-agent-executed setup (WS-4).
- **G-17 (pre-build)** → **Tier Invariant**: the main agent always rides a higher-thinking mount
  than the coding agents; relative ordering, config-validated, flywheel-constrained (§9).

## Banked queue

- Grill-me protocol as in-harness interactive intake (`rmd chat`) — post-WS-4.
- Agent Teams as an optional worker sub-mode for parallel exploration inside one task.
- **Beads import/export adapter** — tasks.yaml stays the schema-tight native substrate; Beads (23k★,
  git-backed agent issue ledger) is the interop target if demand appears.
- ~~Formula/molecule-style reusable task templates~~ **PROMOTED to core as §3A Campaigns** (Craig
  directive, 2026-07-14).
- Wasteland-style federation of the commons across operators (portable, reviewed knowledge
  exchange between installs) — post-WS-11 if the commons gets traction.
- Remote/cloud workers beyond the mini (hyperscaler or Claude Code cloud sandboxes).
- Load/scale story: multiple products, one daemon vs. daemon-per-product.
- ClawApp inbox integration as a notifier adapter (Craig instance).
- Plugin/skill marketplace listing once stable.
- Cross-agent support (Codex exec) — explicitly parked; Claude-first keeps contracts tight.
- Tournament dispatch (two approaches, reviewer picks) for high-risk tasks — expensive, park until
  verdict calibration proves the reviewer.
